micheal is full of surprises
The best boss I ever had - Jimothy Halpert
Pam’s look of pride …
"""They should have taken the money and got jobs somewhere else. I mean, they essentially determined a job application and interview was worth $60,000. They could have had both the money and employment."""

Smile and tearing at the same time
Chap Chap 👋👋 is something that is stuck in my brain so much that I use it everytime to shush someone 🤷🏻‍♂️
"""I love how David Wallace has an infinite well of patience, except when it comes to Ryan"""
"""""""I don't have to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I just have to wait out you.""""

And that was when Michael won."""
Perfect scene to introduce the series to new audiences
"""When Michael says I’ll raise you a situation, that was it. He knew the assignment. The look on Pam’s face is inspired and full of surprise."""
Great way to couch Michael's demand on firing Charles before his other hard sells. Makes it easier for David to accept Pam and Ryan back
“We are so rich.” That was epic 🤣
One of Michael's best.
He really can stand without doing anything and i will be happy to watch him
The best single episode of The Office ever.
One of the best moments in the series !
David was always so believable his position within the show. He really reminds me of a lot of bosses I’ve had in the past they were pretty fair.
"""one of the reasons michael scott is so awesome is he has those moments where he's a genuine badass, and we all love to see him pull it off"""
Another timeline where Stringer Bell survived and became a successful business man.
Greatest finesse of history
This proves Micheal was indeed the best boss ever.
Michaels unwavering love and loyalty to Ryan is the funniest thing about this show. I love it so much.
"""I used to sell cars and I had a boss that was kind of like Michael, except more in the drink and do coke on the job, make very questionable jokes, and verbally abuse the sales staff. However, every once in a while he would come in to close a deal for me and he would be sincere, relatable, convincing, and seconds after walking away he would be back to his old self. It was really nice to see the character of Michael Scott get to be competent, and victorious."""
Good job Michael.
"""This whole arc made me wonder how this company could possibly survive. Multiple large clients were convinced to switch paper providers, then had to switch back when Michaels company folded. All that drama for a paper supplier? I would think that would turn them off of doing business with any of these people."""
"""""""if tomorrow my company goes under I will just start another paper company and then another and another and another.

I have no shortage of company names.""""

I just find this very inspirational"""
Greatest storyline in the office don’t @ me
"""I love this meeting because David keeps waiting to see if Michael will find the right answer, and Michael calmly shows him that he's had it in his back pocket since the meeting started."""
"""I'm passing my pants 😂😂😂😂 half way through after he rejects for second time 60k😁😂this guys is a pro, knows what he's doing🙈😁👌sort of"""
I love howMichael said Jobs are safer while Ryan wanted the 60k. It’s a subtle indicator to why Michael will always be more successful than Ryan despite not being as smart or educated.
' Our balls are in your court '. Why no one is talking about this 😂😂😫
"""It's a nice way of presenting how a good company can and should treat its employees with salary, health benefits, taxes, and social security even within the cutthroat capitalist marketplace."""
I can't tell you the happiness I felt when all these 3 people got what they wanted ❤️
"""This entire episode was masterfully written.
Despite the fact that Scranton was the most profitable branch under Michael's command, David gradually lost his trust in him due to his antics, to the point where he infiltrated Charles as a potential replacement for him given his resume.
But all of this negotiation worked for David both as a solution to the crisis caused by Michael Scott's Paper Company and as a reaffirmation of confidence in Michael's ability to lead the branch.
David had preferred Charles because of his education and his """"focus on results"""", however when Charles found himself in direct competition with Michael, he couldn't figure out how to counteract the attack of Michael's company, he also showed poor judgment when choosing Dwight as his right-hand man instead of Jim, just because of his personal dislike for him. Not to mention that at the negotiation table he didn't contribute anything valuable and showed that he didn't even have a complete overview of the critical situation of Scranton branch.
On the other hand, Michael showed mettle and iron negotiating skills, as well as his loyalty (he could have asked for more benefits for himself and left Pam and Kevin to their fate) and a sense of protection and empathy towards his subordinates (subtle details such as when he tells Pam and Kevin that it is the """"saddest day of his life"""" and is still willing to listen to Pam's """"sad comment"""" and Kevin's confession).
Charles can be the guy who """"focuses on results"""", but ultimately delivers poor ones. On the contrary, Michael is the kind of manager who believes that fostering a good work environment, building subordinates' confidence in their own abilities, and working on jovial and close relationships with clients, will lead to good results in the long run (he showes this during the whole episode and in the end he reaffirm this point in his negociation closing), not to mention that when it comes to of critical negotiations, he becomes a master and the leader he is expected to be (upon deciding he wants to """"trade the fish for the fishing pole"""" he discusses the idea with Pam and Kevin, but when he reaches consensus he shuts them up with authority and determination).
Of course I am aware that he was broke, but I never said he was a good entrepeneur, instead he is an accomplished and capable manager."""
I wish I had a boss like David Wallace
Imagine Micheal said: our balls is in your hands 🤣
Jim's smile to the camera the end says it all
Ehere to watch this for free without virus website
Watching the office for the first time was like a fancy ride..what a show ❤
"""Every time I watch this, it keeps on getting better."""
lol this was so nice
This particular scene just shows why Michael is one of the best salesmen in the history of Dunder Mifflin.
It is very good that the boss is standing and defending his colleagues. It shows how they trust each other's capability and efforts.
"""You can be as smart as you want, be the best at reading people, be entirely evenly matched... But as some point the card's go face-up and the better hand wins.  David knew he was screwed and was hoping Michael didn't know (by this point in the series, the CFO of a company would already know their company model was not sustainable).  Michael hit the nail on the head without even knowing that David was one wrong move away from being replaced as CFO for *years*. 

I mean we all like David, but Dunder-Mifflin was *literally* going under for a long time, and David IS THE CFO.  He's a likable character but doesn't that make it mostly his fault?  Assuming the CEO/Board wasn't strangling any good decision-making power he had?"""
One of the top Michael Scott moments of the show
"""It would be crazy if we heard the sound of Michael kissing someone in the room and they get out awkwardly.

 pam says that he kissed Brian, and Brian says that he kissed pam and that’s it, and Micheal deny it."""
Imagine sitting in that room and keeping a straight face after everything Michael says. Awesome show.
Ok but this one scene still gives me chills
"""0:46
I think this might be one of Michael’s most badass moments in the whole show"""
"""I like how Michael's unexpected wisdom and idioms comes out when it comes to business. """"Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish"""" is such an interesting way to explain what he have in mind."""
I have no shortage of company names😂😂😂
Michael Scott just sold a company worth $0 for over a million

David Wallace really respect and see Michael as a threat thats why he agree on his demands.

"""When Michael actually cares, he's a beast."""

"""""""This company is worth nothing""""😂😂"""
Wonder how many real life bosses watch this show 😄 🤣
Wow
Greater than Wolf of Wall Street
Best
Haha.
This is the amazing negotiation I’ve never been heard before really I think 🤔 spell this scene as wonderful as vow
Michael :- thats one of them... 🤣🤣🤣
“Our balls are in your court” 😂😂😂 but I wouldn’t mess with Stringer 🛎 so much.
"""2:51 Sometimes I wonder if Michael was desperate to get his job back after realising that running a business was an absolute nightmare or if he let go of his pride to ensure he, Pam and Ryan get better jobs with more benefits. BTW 'gone' doesn't mean fired so the 2nd best thing is that Pam becomes a sales person."""
04:12 ♥
Lol...
The thing I like the most about this scene is that how Ryan and Pam never interrupt Michael during his discussion with David and question his judgement in front of him . Thus kind of giving Michael more authority than he regularly gets. Probably this makes David even more serious about Michael.
this episode was cool cause Jim was routing for Michael to winn and Dwight whos always up his but was wanting David to win. Cool episode when it came along
You can leave the room please 😎😂😂
This was honestly one of the biggest character moments for Michael Scott that redeemed him despite all of his cringy and socially unacceptable moments and made us all root for him and think highly of him in our hearts
"""Smile on Pam's face at 1:09, as if to say, for all of his oddities, this is why I went to work for this guy."""
"""Deal?

Deal....Can we have the room please..😂"""
I think this is where Michael found the sentence along the way
This is just sooo satisfying to watch😊
“ we are so rich “
One of the best part of this episode.
So besides Pam switching to sales and them getting dental what did they gain from all this?  Are they back to where they started?
Great scene.
"""""""Our balls are in your court"""" 🤣"""
"""“So I don’t think I have to wait out Dunder mifflin, I just think I have to wait out you” one of the best lines on the show"""
"""Definitely should have shown the bit where Michael gets revenge on Charles and says """"Nope, you're done"""" Possibly Michael's greatest line in the show"""
"""If Micheal wanted he could have been the BEST BOSS there is.. but he just wanted to be the COOLEST BOSS there is 
<3"""
"""I've no shortage of company names.
Michael!
That's one of them!"""
It's amazing Michael was able to turntables onto David Wallace negotiating to keep his own job. He did seem like a pushover for Michael's antics throughout his career with DM
3:59 me every time I get blocked 😂😂😂
"""I think we can agree that before this, Michael is seen as a goofy boss that every once in a while gets something right (and mostly by chance)...but this is the episode that left us with the feeling of """"i'll never underestimate this guy again"""""""
kelly XD
Our company is worth nothing!
He was powerful
"""""""You have a stockholders meeting coming up and you have to explain to them why your most successful branch is bleeding.

our balls are in your court🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can we take a moment to appreciate how delicious David Wallace is 😍
I love when the only time David gets even the slightest turnt up is when Ryan is discussed. Ha! He literally has the MOST patience for Michael above all lmao
He was an idiot but this is the one thing he was brilliant at throughout the show its tru u could be clueless in one way and be a genius in others
"""this show hahahah the quotes... """"our balls are in your court"""" ! hahahahha ha hI'm dying"""
That subtle gulp from Michael when he reacted to the 60 thou!! 😆
for tv films or entertainment purposes only. This will never happen in real life :) but its sure fun to watch!
"""“i have no shortage of company names” 
“michael…”
“THATS ONE OF THEM!! YES!!”

the thought of a paper company called michael is hilarious 🤣🤣"""
I bet Michael Scott can sell a pen to The Wolf of Wall Street everyday of the week lol
4:57 Jim’s precious smile
1:09 Pam’s proud look
"""I LOVE THIS. Some of the greatest scenes in the entire Office is when Michael is selling. 

The Client, Travelling Salesman, Business Trip, The Sting, bonuses scenes from the Carpet, and obviously this episode are all great example of competent Michael."""
Brilliant
"""Ah, yes. The negotiator"""
We are so rich😂
"""Michael may be stupid, but he's not an idiot."""
"""When Michael said “ our company worth nothing “
My heart dropped I thought he screwed this after everything he did in the scene but it turned out the twist was so delicious !"""
My favorite scene
Jim's smile at the end was so good!
"""""""yes she is, at the Michael Scott paper company... In it's hay day."""" Loooool"""
He plays very well don't underestimate him
"""Ryan: It wasn't personal. Michael: """"Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world"""" It was old quote from previous seasons, but here we see clearly Michaels point of view. He is really serious with business."""
"""Michael Corleone: I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Michael Scott: what's your second offer"""
In the end David Wallace was the richest guy at The Office
"""I think this is one of the reasons why David has put up with all of Michael's antics. Not only because Mr. Wallace himself has patience, but also because he's seen and knows of Michael's capability. He knows that under that huge layer of foolishness, and immaturity, there's a great salesman somewhere lost underneath. That salesman isn't always present but when that inner salesman comes out wonders could happen. Like the meeting at Chilli's with the other guy and Jan. 

Some of you might argue that no this is only because of Mr. Wallace's patience. One could only be patient if they know or feel some smidge of success. When someone knows there will be no chance of success a person will have zero tolerance for that. Likewise Mr. Wallace knows Michael is capable and because of that is willing to be patient with him."""
Why does Michael love Ryan so much? 😂
I really don't get it how $60k can make you rich? In my country that kind of money only can buy cheap Car.
"""Great piece of writing.

If that was Brent, I'm sure he would of been arrested 😂"""
Micheal and his squeeker farts of brilliance..😁
Michael Scott was a badass in this once scene..
"""Under all that stupidity and games and childishness, when push came to shove Michael Scott played the game and came out on top like. The OG salesman."""

"""Greatest 3 negotiators of all time Michael scott , thomas shelby michael corleone ."""
"""I think in Michaels eyes, Ryan is like a baby bird with his mouth open that Michael feels compelled to feed (with whole slices of bread, of course). Because Michael is that baby birds mother."""
This scene made me understand why Michael’s a manager 🤣
This moment & Michael successfully making his sales pitch at Chili’s way back in season 2 are michael’s most brilliant displays of business savvy in the whole series
My favourite ever moment in the show. Just shows the best side of Michael in that he pulls a middle finger to the ones who doubted him and does it in a hillarious Michael Scott way.
Probably my favorite scene in the entire show.
The acting/ writing in this scene is just too perfect. Absolutely hilarious.
Wait is Michael actually smart?
The best scene of all
4:12 So Michael DID pull off his lean back move to showcase dominance which he couldn't do with Darryl haha!
The fact that they knew Michael would keep going and going until he found success made him a big risk and possible competition!! Michael was a top salesman with them and they knew he had what it took to be successful
"""Michael is by far the best salesman in the office, issue is that he's way to bussy playing """"cool"""""""
"""This is the first time I have seen this style of video, which makes me want to watch it again and again. Is this the content of any movie or TV play? I want to know what kind of background they are in when negotiating."""
This just straight up makes you realize why Michael became the Manager at such a young age. He legit knows his stuff. Also Michael was such a badass in this scene when he said “you’re done” to Charles.
Jims efforts and his smile at the end was priceless!
Anyone else wish they had a boss willing to fight for them like this? Lol
"""David's face at 1:10 is fantastic: You can read """"touché"""" in his eyes"""
"""I really like that 'this isn't about paper, I can start a paper company any day' thing, its hard to beat someone who can't be bought but has passion."""
"""Michael Scott was a bumbling goofball on a good day and an idiot on a bad day. But I gotta admit, I fucking LOVED him in this scene! I wanted to stand and clap at home when I first saw it. He FINALLY got one over on Corporate!"""
Might be one my favorite scenes … love this show
This is one of the few times Michael Scott really showed balls and intelligence.
This is my favorite scene in all of TV
Greatest Michael Scott moment all time.
That lump he swallowed (with sound) at the 60k offer is just..... Fkin too good man.... Just absolutely gold standard hilarious.
"""1:05

Michael Scott was the smartest in this episode.

"""wow! I didn't see that coming. while negotiating the sale of his company, he manages to fathom the gravity of the situation..."""
This is my favorite scene along with when Michael sells working for  Dunder Mifflin to Danny Cordray.

I was blown out when I watched this episode for the first time...so intense... Steve carell is awesome
"""I love when Michael is competent, and when he stands up for Pam.   So this is my favorite Office scene."""

"""With Michael’s personality, we forget how smart he really is"""
"""Don't know if it made a connection but I remember the episode where Darryl comes to Michael about getting a raise, Michael reads some interview tactics in the book.

Love Idris Elba however I hate Charles!
"""""""Our company is worth nothing"""" gives me the chills"""
"""They gasp at $60,000 and say """"We are so rich!"""", but in reality, by season five all three of them made a minimum $100,000 per episode, and Steve Carell makes 175,000 per episode."""
"""""""I want a sebring"""" lol"""
Man that feeling when you get what you want through negotiation is incredible.
Pam was much more attractive when she was submissive
they could have accept the offer and find jobs somewhere else :D
"""""""Our company is worth nothing""""

Always bring shiver and tears. Goddamn that was a brilliant acting"""
1:05 when she gives you this look… you know the friendship level is high
"""20K for each of them would be next to nothing. A nice new car, maybe, or a year of a minimum wage job's salary.

Jim is good

I LOVE how Stanley is silently grinning in the background as they are celebrating
Creed im the background chewing something is pretty hilarious.
"""Ya know that “sell me this pen” scene? Well, that’s how Michael does it. Without paper, how do you get an autograph?"""

"""""""Ryan: How can you do this to me? You just cost me $60 000"""" LOL."""
"""Michael Scott is such a good negotiator, like he’s genuinely great at business"""
1:46 omg omg we are so rich! lmao
"""""""we are so rich"""" 😂"""
You can see by the end that even David is a bit impressed!
This is my favorite clip of the office
Michael just didn't give David any chance 🤣 🔥
I like that Charles decides to stop working at dunder mifflin and become a high tec mercenary who's friends with a shark
You keep thinking how did Michael ever get the manager position and then they sprinkle in moments like these throughout the series and you realize why Michael is such a great manager
"""Freakin Jim and that last look though. I love the guy, but Jack Ryan is still just Jim. Sorry man."""

This seems very unrealistic .. a Publicly traded company buying out  smaller and newer companies that would cost  millions over time without seeing the books..... pffft ya right ....... (-future Dwight Shrute)
Would you rather have a fish or a fishing rod Michael can make great analogies when he wants to
Even David was impressed
I always wondered how Michael became a manager when he doesn't work that hard. This episode just showed what he's got what it takes to be a manager.
"""Michael was insanely smart when he demanded to fire Charles, he didn't say it just because he wanted Charles fired. The demand was turned down but it was a good a leverage to demand Pam and Ryan to be back at Dunder Mifflin.

This is the only time that Michael Scott showed why he is the best salesman in the show.
Youtube should have the option to like a video twice. This one deserves it.
The US Office is great but the whole mockumentary style doesn’t really fit does it?
Seriously they have cut the scene when Dwight is trying to tell Charles that Michael’s company is actually broke but Jim interrupts him in so funny way? I came here only for this :D
David  respected Michael for the way he handled everything.

1:11 you can tell David respected Michael greatly from his counter response.
He’s such a genius 😭😭 I hate him but I love him at the same time
"""When talking about business, everyone are playing checkers, while Michael is playing chess."""
Greatest series ever
Michael should also get 'Best Negotiator' Coffee cup on his desk...
Smartest thing is for Michael to only take a job and Ryan and Pam split the cash. Then Michael rehires. Took me 12 years to think of this
"""If I was Pam or Ryan I would rather have part of 60k$, they had entry level job anyway, so they would be better off with extra cash and just look for another job. The only winner here is Michael."""
"""I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family, he’s like a son to me"""
I like how Jim smiled at the end he knew they were back💯
Pam smiling after seeing Michael negotiate in first scene was literally  everyone's reaction.
This is the best scene from entire series 😂
"""The camera work when David offers 60k is phenomenal.
That little zoom right at the end. Barely noticeable, but it makes it so much funnier"""
Never underestimate Micheal !
"""I’m sure this David Wallace is a CEO somewhere, for real."""
Michael Paper Company would have been 🔥🤣
David Wallace was a great job to Michael. There is a level of respect he had for Michael. And down the line Michael also helped David too. They had a good match.
This is the climax of the entire show. It shows Michael at his very best. He always wanted to do two things in life: accomplish something big in business and care about his friends. In this scene he pulls off both.
the way Jim came through for them was the best
"""1 of the BEST episodes! Love the way Michael talked to David...set him straight (although I always liked the way David appreciated Michael, in his own way)!"""
"""For whoever that may be amazed by Michael's negotiation skills, just remember he got to be regional manager because he once was a legendary salesman"""
Because blinds block sound 🤣
Inspiring Michael Scott came out here even tho he fumbled the delivery.
these series of episodes where they created the michael scott paper company we’re so good!! i love this show❤️
Our balls in your court 🤣
"""“I don’t care if Ryan kills his whole family, he’s like a son to me.” 

These writers are geniuses!"""
Everyone’s talking about Pam’s look of pride for Michael but no ones talking about the wry smile David gives Michael when he outsmarts him
Our balls are in your court.  Haha!!
the most innocently human comedy ever made
David Wallace. 🤣
And then people say that Micheal did not deserve to be the regional manager!!!! God this man's got brains with balls
I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family! He’s like a son to me! 🤣🤣
Greatest salesman of all time
"""Like a father taking care of his 2 child, very adorable. Respect to the writer and actor"""
"""Michael brain functions properly only once in a while, but man, when it does, you have to be careful"""
"""The unknown steven quickly injure because defense supposedly sneeze sans a creepy ship. exotic, hallowed mandolin"""
"""The mysterious alloy neuropathologically heat because sofa dimensionally join under a super circle. fallacious, untidy lamb"""
This was my favorite Michael moment. He kept a level head and knew exactly what he was doing. Look at Pam's face when he says he just needs to wait out David. She's so proud of him.
"""David Wallace was like: I'm so proud of you son, anyway, how about 60 thousand dollars?"""
Favorite episode of the entire show!
"""The two times Michael didn't say """"that's what she said"""" were glorious for him. He got his job back and he got Holly"""
He didn't end up actually agreeing that Charles would leave
0:49 to 1:08 mic drop 🖐️🎤
Easily my favourite scene
"""I know that The Office is a legendary show because after a long and exhausting day working at the office, I come home and watch The Office to relax."""
Michael was a badass here
His best sale ever
Somehow I manage is filled with negotiation tactics like the ones used here.
"""Michael Scott is The Office.  That show lived and died by his character.  That being said, he was a socially inept fool 90% of the time.  Hysterical, but a fool.  This scene is one of a handful of scenes throughout his time on the show when he was not a fool.  And when he wasn't a fool, he was awesome.  He surprised everyone and knocked it out of the park."""
“Our balls are in your court” almost choked on my food😂😂
Michael realized his highest form of self and summoned a level of awareness he didn’t even know he had 😂 phenomenal scene
Smartest moment of Michael Scott.
"""“I don’t care if Ryan murdered his whole family, he is like a son to me.”
After so many years jokes just keep on coming."""
One of the top scenes ever
1:05 Pam looks so proud of him
Best best best. I just want that confidence when negotiating.
Jenna Fischer is such a great actress. Her subtle expressions adds so much detail to a scene. She's Highly Underrated
Wish we had more serious/cool moments like this
My fav Michael Scott moment.
"""Here's the situation... lol I've had meetings like that but more like, """"hey you're charismatic and people keep following you. Why?"""" They didn't like the answer."""
Can we just appreciate how patiently he closed the window curtanis at 4:43 .
"""Silly negotiations at times, but brilliant interaction between Andy Buckley and Steve Carrell. 
Idris Elba (Charles) said this was one of his favorite observational acting moments."""
Best episode?
Yeah babe!°
I love how they keep making them leave the room 🤣 ultimate power move
No wonder Michael Scott won as the best salesman for two consecutive years
Kelly! 🤣
0:25 sounds like The Peanuts  teacher
Micheal is so cool when he’s not an idiot.
"""Angela: """"What do you hear?""""
Kelly: """"wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo""""
LOL Kelly."""
That look at pams face. When she realises how brilliant michael is.. ❤
Michael Scott showing why he's the World's Best Boss👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"""3:25 Idris Elba trying hard not to laugh😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣

I freaking love David Wallace! Such a great character! ❤️❤️❤️"""
This is probably my favorite scene in the whole series
Wow.. is that Idris Elba there in a minuscule role?!
"""David Wallace is the only, the ONLY character in the entire show who is close to a virtuous person."""
Michael's brain pretty much sacrificed everything else for phenomenal salesmanship
3:30 :''') i wish my boss like that
"""Charles miner is just there like """"....what just happened"""""""
Michael is absolutely loyal to the bone. He fought for those two. Respect ✊🏿
"""I love how the acting feels so natural.
Its like actual real people"""
Charles is about as valuable as diarrhea in the middle of the Sahara.
The true art of deal XD
This scene is the only time I respected michael scott
"""He definitely deserved that """"world's best boss"""" mug"""
"""This is one of my absolute favorite scenes of the entire show, I love Michael going toe to toe with Wallace and beating him. Gets me emotional honestly."""
"""I don’t think “how’s about 60,000 USD” is proper English, but if David Wallace says it, then i accept it is proper English"""
the only time I've ever seen David angry was when Ryan was running reception 🤣🤣
"""My entire opinion of Michael Scott changed on this one scene alone. I always thought that his good and his bad points were equal, so I didn't see him as a net positive. This whole ordeal was amazing, the way he negotiated so tactfully, and especially the way he truly looked out for friends by not taking the easy way out (the $60,000). The best part is that right before this, he was absolutely sure that he was going to blow it and give up the fact that his company was broke, but he turned it around so masterfully that he got them all better than what they had before.

This is where Michael Scott's genius really got to shine. I had never, ever been prouder of him than in this episode, and I'm so thankful he got this moment."""
"""So they got their jobs back and Pam became a sales person. But they didnt get the 60k on top, right ?"""
Here impressed with micheal decision..he is too smart sometimes 😀
probably the best episode.
It actually was the cheapest solution considering those positions were already allocated within the budget of the company therefore it is a zero cost buyout
Michael Scott is truly one of a kind
"""""""I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation"""" lmao"""
Michael is clever. If only he felt socialy accepted he would be a genius and not acting like a child most of the time to win some friends
Every word of this scene is just perfect
"""""""Our company is worth nothing!"""" Just realized he did say they were broke, when they were trying hard not to. But it worked! Because they had nothing to lose. One of Michael's greatest moments, I think."""
I have no shortage of company names 😂😂
"""i always thought when michael said “my company is worth nothing” , i had a huge feeling they would be like okay good bye no more deal"""
Thats Michael. G. Scot ladies and gentleman.😎
"""Micheal was absolutely brilliant here. He saw through all the numbers, identified his opponents' real weaknesses, and played his bargaining chips masterfully."""
David Wallace is actually a cool boss
Michael was so smart that God had to negotiate by keeping his mouth hard to keep shut
They're lucky Stringer Bell didn't just fake their suicides
I love how Ryan thought he'd get the whole 60K
“I will just start another paper company. I have no shortage of company names” 😂😂😂😂😂
I loved how Jim tried his level best to make the negotiations in Pam's favour without leaking any valuable information officially ❤️
"""I've always liked David Wallace. He's a very smart, level-headed executive. At 1:09, you can see the respect David has for Michael by going toe to toe with him about the offer. Even though everyone knows Michael's antics can be both hilarious and reckless, David understands Michael's passion for the paper supply business and his loyalty to his people. Michael Scott is the real deal and so is David Wallace."""
"""sometimes we forget that michael is the manager of the scranton branch, which means he must be good at what he does if he got promoted and kept that job for, what?, 10?, 15 years?"""
I just realized Kelly sounds like Chopper from Rebels 0:25
When you watch an episode of suits XD
"""I have no shortage of company names
Michael-
*That's one of them*"""
"""No doubt Michael was one of the best salesmen. Cause when he means buisness he means """"buisness"""""""
1:07 i had the same reaction. michael is badass when it comes to sales!!
I love david wallace
"""HOLD UP WAIT
does michael talk in a low voice to the point where they cant hear him cuz its one of the forms of negotiation to control the room like he did w Darryl

DID I JUST DISCOVER SOMETHING"""
This video makes me happy
"""Now that I think about it the offer Michael asked for might not be that big of a deal. Since they're getting rid of Charles who is definitely getting paid more than what Michael got, with Michael back, they are only geting a sales person plus a temp, which means they're not pay much more than when Michael was the boss. Not a bad deal"""
how is 60k rich ?> rofl...
"""It was Jim in the end who saved them by sabotaging nosy Dwight, and in the end his smile says it all."""
Could’ve Michael taken 60 grand then leave Michael Scott make a new one with 60 grand with Pam and Ryan maybe 1 or 2 more people and build up into a empire
"""Can we all agree that michael gave pam the opportunity she always wanted and he got something the other employees do not have """"dental"""". What a guy"""
"""He’s so smart Lol. I wish we got to see more of serious Micheal Scott in the show,"""
My favorite scene of the entire series.
Michael selling his company was a battle between him a David and he won fabulously
He asked Charles to be fired which was impossible which made his request for Pam to be in sales be more sane to agree on. An amazing psychological trick played beautifully!
"""I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up, and you're going to have to explain why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO, so I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin, I think I just have to wait out you.


Whoaaa..."""
Excellent writing and acting
"""""""I have no shortage of company names""""
""""Michael..."""" 
""""That's one of 'em!"""
3:52 i found what michael said is very very inspiring.
"""Well well well, how the turntables...."""
"""All things aside, he is a wonderful salesman."""
"""michael's """"no you're done"""" at the end of the episode is straight up MY FAVORITE MOMENT IN THE SHOW"""
2:24 Ryan: how could you do this to me Michael...you cost me 60k😂
The Micheal Scott Paper Company arc has two moments of Micheal deep down really being waaay smarter than we give him credit for. He isn't a total idiot. This moment right here and the speech he gives Pam.
Lol never knew Idris Elba was in the Office
The was the best
"""""""I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin, I think I just need to wait out you."""" probably one of his best real talks he delivered."""
"""Michael was the smartest person in this room, and it's amazing to see 👏🏼"""
I love that Michael has no hesitation when he says he wants Pam in sales. That tells me he never intended to put her back in reception. It shows his respect and love for her.
"""I like Angela leaning into Kelly’s ear, like she’s going to be able to hear inside the conference room through Kelly. 🤣🤣"""
The wise man plays the fool.
I needed more of smart business man Michael
"""12,000 to 60,000 in 30 seconds. 🤣
And if you can't authorize 60k, then why am I even dealing with you?  Get me the person who can deal."""
"""The thing about Michael is that he's not cut out to be a boss. That's it. That's his character flaw. Corporate recognised him for the masterful salesman that he is and made him a manager. Manager and salesman are two different things. If someone is an amazing aerospace engineer, that doesn't mean you can just move them up into the cockpit of a space shuttle. Every time Michael steps outside of his role as a boss, everyone immediately sees him in a completely different light - They see a genius negotiator, a warm-hearted, extroverted and very perceptive person, and a man with surprising amounts of wisdom.

Interestingly, Jim's not cut out to be a boss either. That one day he replaces Michael as acting manager everything falls apart spectacularly and the staff hates him more than they hate Michael."""
"""If this was a house of cards type show you'd think michael scott did all this deliberately. Like quitting and working with the aim of asserting his control back to what he had before he left. However in the reality of this show Michael fell into this situation and then made the most of it somehow. He showed hidden talents like you see with other characters. Talents that somehow got him the job of regional manager,  that led him somehow making his branch the most profitable."""
I like how they decided to make Michael smart for this one moment
"""3:48 And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why Michael Scott is such an amazing and fascinating character..."""
FUN FACT: This episode was directed by Steve Carell :)
"""Feels like a bit of a plot hole that Michael demands Charles be gone, David flat out refuses, and then Michael kicks Charles out and he never sets foot in Scranton again. Seems like they should have just added a line or two where they agree Scranton reports directly to David but Charles stays with the company."""
I would have loved a scene where Michael and Robert California have a debate.
Michael is smarter than other characters give him credit for
1:35 david seemed very happy because he thought they were going to say ok for 60k. he thought he handled the whole situtation at a bargain price. Because his offer was still low
I love how Michael says back in its heyday. Lol
Michael went from 6.000 to a multimillion dollar deal .. All hail Michael
4:48 close your eyes and listen 😂😂😂
"""3:22 what makes Micheal """"World's Best Boss"""""""
Try to understand how they are really celebrating. Oh Yess!!  4:52
"""0:24 That's actually sweet how Angela makes physical contact with Kelly, almost seems out of character."""
I was honestly taken aback on how smart Michael actually played this negotiation out when I first saw this scene.
"""Honestly, I think Michael could sell the doom marine his own friggin helmet."""
"""The nimble chive cytogenetically thank because australia longitudinally suppose across a purring receipt. adventurous, dusty stream"""
"""""""Yeah"""" gets med every time"""
It’s incredible when Michael actually acts like an adult...
"""""""How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000!"""" 

lmao"""
Just like Jim said he does a bit of critical thinking
This is my favorite scene of micheal Scott you see how smart he actually is and it’s great to see him. Come thru for Pam on my second rewatch just passed this episode
"""Watch the episode about Michael learning how to negotiate in the earlier season ,then watch this. You realized he actually applied all the tricks, even the one made to make the audience laugh at first. (speakly quietly, never accept the first offer). Except this time, it's working he's more mature with it.

This is actually genius writing! Very subtle touch"""
Dayum michael is a great orator
I get david wallaces decision. Its a lot easier to day ‘were hiring three people’ than it is to say ‘were buying an empty business run by a disgruntled former employee’
"""Michael is an idiot. But also a genius. When it comes to making people happy, or getting what he wants, he goes all in."""
jim kinda saved their asses by stopping dwight fromm telling their company's statuss to charles
I love how they show pam's reaction at the first half and ryan's at the second. Both are good but ryan's face is more satisfying.
The smile on pam at 1.10
Jim's smile at the end 😊
He’s so smart
Definitely one of my fav episodes
Top 10 of my favourite episodes
To be honest if we look closely it’s Jim who saved Michael by proving Dwight wrong...
"""I think by the end David Wallace just wanted the whole thing over, but also I think he saw the value in Michael as an employee and wanted him back. Plus axing Charles made up for one salary so."""
Probably one of my favourite scenes. Shows the true & caring intentions of Michael for his co-workers.
My respect for Michael because of this scene: 📈📈
Pam was so proud of him
"""""""Our balls are in your court""""...😂"""
Well well well... How the turntables...
0:45 was freaking awesome
"""Michael: I have no shortage of company names
David: Michael...
Michael: Thats one of them!"""
This is in my top 3 scenes from the show.
Let us not forget that little yet crucial thing that Jim did that helped everything to happen
"""i love how Michael shushes Ryan

"""I don’t care if Ryan murdered his whole family, he is like a son to me .. .

This was one of my favorite moments and the most badass scene ever
"""The Godfather: """"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse""""
Michael : """" What is your second offer"""""""
Easily the best scene in the entire series.
Michael might say some dumb things but he is the most caring person ever. He just wants everyone to be happy.
"""""""Our balls are in your court."""". One of the best deadpan lines in the whole series."""
Lol the idea of a company just called “Michael” is hilarious to me for some reason
I wish Ryan got better development
This is a brilliant scene
"""I just want to know in what world 60,000 dollars is rich?? Lol"""
This is why Michael Scott is the most powerful salesperson in the branch.
Yes Michael knows there is more to life than simply making money.  That is why the Scranton branch is also the most profitable
I’m sorry but is no one gonna talk about how proud Pam looked when Michael was talking about the stockholders meeting? Like you could tell that she gained so much respect for him there.
"""The satisfying barge eventually step because russian ultrasonographically save within a waggish poppy. smart, auspicious hedge"""
David Wallace is not a smart CFO if he thinks buying a company for $0 to hire the people to work for salary is a multi million dollar buyout. That's just stupid. It's like someone applies for a job making 100k and you go whoa I'm not giving you 3 million dollars! And you say whoa? And he goes well assuming you work here for 30 years and I'm not counting all the work you will do here. So yeah you're asking for a 3 million dollar gift!
"""Ryan is like a son to me, don’t care if he kills his entire family"""
This is definitely the best scene I enjoyed forever of the show.
Watch 4:48 with your eyes closed xD

Michelle is so good to Ryan. It's amazing.
"""I know this might be a little fresh for you, but David Wallace is my favorite person in the entire series."""
Micheal is like the Mr. Magoo of business.
"""The Office is extremely well written and thought out.  Its seems unplanned, but in reality every detail is important and each character stays true to their character."""
Third time they didn't remove jackets as they knew they would have to leave the room again 😂

I’m not getting the Ryan is like a son to me joke someone explain
"""“I don’t care if he murders his entire family, he’s like a son to me”"""
David Wallace is a good dude!
"""1:19 YES GOD, YES GOD PLS YES, YYEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"""
Michael only does all his antics to keep the documentary entertaining
Say what you want about Michael and as incompetent as he might be as a manager he was a great salesman and not ashamed to talk the talk.
Pam's smile just shows how proud she is of Michael at that point..
I think this is my favorite scene of the entire series
"""I love how at the end of this whole endeavor Michael is in the same spot that he was in, but the two people he cares for most saw a serious improvement in their professional lives...and he was so happy about it."""
Michael may be a terrible boss.....but boy is he the best salesman
$60k for a buyout and they lose it lmao
0:49 Michael shows us how he became the best salesman
*Michael is like a mafia boss he made an offer that they can't refuse*
I love how in the end Wallace looks at Michael as if he was proud of him
"""I always wonder if Ryan on any level appreciated Michael, especially after this....It would have been cool if Ryan (on camera, had of been stunned that Michael felt that way) had of tried harder to impress Michael."""
Despite everything Michael was always a great salesman...
"""« Our balls are in your court »

"""1:09 that smile Pam makes is just golden. It's like at that point, she realized she was right to believe in Michael."""
We’re so rich. Lol
Pam is more loyal than Dwight
I like to believe that before the documentary started (in that fictional world) michael was a somewhat normal person. but sometimes slightly eccentric people become extremely eccentric when they are the centre of THAT much attention.
David is one of my favorites
Our balls are in your court.... SOunds dark and funny sometimes
I love idris movies though
"""0:45

"""I love michaels cringy humor, but when he is actually being competent it just hits different"""
"""The amazing whorl advisably stroke because look regularly welcome save a daily windscreen. purring,  far-flung mall"""

I wish they gave us more of this Michael Scott. World’s Best Boss.
"""1:08 I have that exact look on my face cause nobody really expected this from someone like Michael but oh well, he's a boss for a reason"""
I can see the excitement and hope on Ryan's face at the final discussion. He puts all his hope on Michael in that moment.
“I’ll see your situation and raise you a situation” lmao
"""This scene honesty made me so happy, I never seen Michel just spit so many facts all in one sentence. 😌"""
"""I think if Stanley was in the room, then he'd definitely respect Michael

P.S. respect for slipping in Dental care"""
Well well well. How the turntables.
"""“I dont care Ryan murdered his entirely family, he is like a son to me.” I totally missed that the first ten times i watched this."""
This scene is soo good because it has you believe that Micheal will screw the negotiation up but then he gains the upper hand by playing his cards right like a genius. And it really shows how good of a boss Micheal Scott was.
"""Even though Michael was in his best here, we gotta appreciate what Jim did behind the scenes sabotaging Dwight in front of Charles Miner. Even that was very crucial."""
I love this scene.
"""I love how all three of them leaned back as soon as Micheal said """"our balls are in your court"""""""
Our company is worth nothing....that's the line you need to understand deeply.
Now david wallace know how high micheal can fly...and now he need come down to scranton to see micheal like he should do in first place when micheal is manager...see how much they already cost lose money bcause micheal...proof upper management should never understimate lower employee
"""That's the weird thing about Michael.  Could close a deal with the best of them, but couldn't close a door without issues."""
'Our balls are in your court.' The writers were so good.

Ok to be fair.. Ryan should be gone
“I will just make another and another and another “ 😂 Micheal is goated

The greatest negoatiation that took tv history
"""Love this scene. Michael recognises that Pam wants a sales job and taps into hidden IQ points out of nowhere and levels them both. """"I think I just need to wait out you"""" always gives me chills."""
"""At the end of the day, Michael was a goofball who nonetheless loved his job and the people who worked for him. This scene captures both of those feelings perfectly."""
Michael knows about the stock holder meeting and management?  Surprising.
"""Michael is like a child, and it’s really hard negotiating with children."""
"""Underrated part of the scene - Jim's smile at the end when Michael, Pam and Ryan celebrate. Goes to show he was really rooting for them the whole time The Michael Scott Paper Company existed."""
3:48 I LOVE HIM SO MUCH FOR THIS
I feel like I'm going to use the lines Michael used in the future
This only works because David is a huge pushover.
Our balls are in your court 😂 I forgot about that line
"""""""Our balls are in your court""""  🤣"""
I would love Michael as my manager. I can put up with his things. How many boss care about their employees? He knew Sprinkles. Can you walk up to your boss and say I feel bored? Can you come to work whenever you want?  The reason Scranton branch is doing well is because it is a healthy work environment people work because they want to and not because they have to.

For a comedy show. Micheal going tit for tat with David was so badass. Didn’t think I’d ever see micheal be such a hardass. Probably one of my favourite shows
Michael Scott always finishes strong

"""In the end, David Wallace chose to save his own skin and fire Charles hahaha."""
This is the best moment in the series
"""One of my fav moments in the show, shows how much of a boss Michael really is"""
Best!
"""After a while, David realised he couldn't outdo Micheal and just gave in and became his friend. Absolutely love the  friendship between the two men"""
This would be one of my favorite shows if they balanced his intelligent moments (like this) with his idiocy 💯
The happiness I felt for Michael for negotiating and getting his old job back... I was literally giddy from it. It's one of the few moments that REALLY stood out. We saw a vulnerable side of him when he quit. We also saw a very intelligent and persausive salesman side of Michael. Something we never saw before. This scene shows Michael's heart for his work and collegues. You can think what you want of him but this scene will never fail to bring respect to him.
"""“I don’t care if he murdered his entire family, He is like a son to me”"""

This is one of my most favorite episodes
"""Angela: “what do you hear?”
Kelly: *proceeds to speak like the adults in Charlie Brown*"""
"""""""Our balls are in your court"""". 😂"""
“Our balls are in your court” it’s funny and doesn’t sound right but when you actually think about it it makes sense!
"""I still believe that Michael Scott is not only the dumbest and most funniest person in a room, but also the most smartest."""
"""although its a show. real life it never happens like that. Higher company usually has upper hand on this type of situation. in real life, Company usually dont offer employment in negotiation and you usually get cash offered which you are expected to take."""
Our balls are in your court XD :D
I love pam because she is loyal to Micheal and believed in him... anyway that negotiation is humiliation to David and Charles 🤭
"""1:21
at this moment, comedy on tv changed forever"""
1:06-1:09.. Pam A Lama Ding Dong was ready to risk it all.
"""""""Our balls are in your court"""" this maybe the best dialogue of  office."""
I love when Michael is serious. 95% of his screentime he's a bumbling idiot which makes it all the more impactful when he occasionally shows his mental and emotional strength. Really loved the Michael Scott Paper Company storyline for having so many of those moments.
I love how the writers really show how he can go from sales genius to the usual naive dolt that he is in matter of seconds  0:46 to 1:28 back to 2:31 to 3:28 back to 3:48 😂😂😂 this is why he is so lovable.
"""Michael is actually a smart business man, the only thing limiting him are his antics and social skills, that's why David was always cool with him"""
This was fucking brilliant
best episode ever
The level of respect for this scene
I am so glad Michael's negotiation skills have improved since his meeting with Darryl regarding his raise lol
"""On a day to day basis, michael is one of the biggest jerks in the world, on the flip side In something serious, beware of his intelligence and be thankful he is on ur side, if he is that is"""
"""Michael is a pretty sharp and focus character when he does care for something or someone, and I think the fact that his own company and the 2 people that believed in him are in a tough spot the best of him comes out."""
"""Pam's not a sales perso-
""""YES SHE IS. In the Michael Scott Paper Campany, at its heyday!""""
RESPECT MICHAEL."""
Love how Wallace just goes with it when Michael straight out asks for the second offer first
Michael in this scene was so intelligent.
This was the best story arc
Love the subtle look Michael has on his face just before he rejects the bigger offer. You can tell it dawns on him that they need something more long lasting than just a big payoff
I love how everyone would be expecting Michael to do something stupid but in this scene he's probably the smartest guy in the room..
"""Literally 99% of the people won't see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment.

David Wallace was always patient with Michael. He was a great CFO
“Our balls are in your court” 😂
he just couldnt resist telling them that the company is worth nothing:)
"""“Our company is worth *nothing,*



That’s the difference between you and I. Business isn’t a bout money, to me, David.”"""
Cool moment
"""This is hands down one of my favorite scenes on this show. It proves Michael's competence and determination. It gives us a reason to like Michael beside of his antics with other characters. This is why you should show him some respect. """"I don't get no respect!"""""""

"""- I have no shortage of company names

"""Of all the great lines in this show, """"I'll see your situation and raise you a situation"""" delivered with such magnitude, has got to be one of my favorite Michael Scott moments of all time."""
The audible gulp after he gets the 60k offer is perfect.
I love this movie.
Stringer really came a long way LOL
Is that heimdel?😂😂
"""4:56 I get that Michael's sudden ingeniousness here is amazing, but why is no one talking about Jim's little smile at 4:56 when he's hearing his friends celebrate? That's gold to me."""
"""Jim is the true hero, if he didn't put his neck out for them to make Dwight look like a fool in the right moment? Dwight would of told Charles about the company going under causing this to end terribly for them."""
"""""""Michael....""""
""""THAT'S ONE OF THEM!!""""

I laughed too hard at that"""
I felt MAD RESPECT for Michael like I've never felt before in the show.
"""Just saying, $12,000 which would be 4 grand each roughly, and considering the company was only really around for about a month as David said, $4000 for one months work? Not too shabby and that was only his second offer😂"""
"""I don't mean this to be, well, mean. But everyone is freaking out over the thing Michael said in the beginning, can someone tell me the impressive part and why it's impressive?"""
Watching this video is made me want to go binge watch it all again.... I'd somehow how good this show at its best
4:48 Why are their voices slightly muffled when their microphones should still be picking up their audio perfectly?
"""That smile that Pam gives the camera after Michael says """"I think we just have to wait out you"""" is so precious. It's like she realized that she believed in Michael and was right for doing so. It's great."""
"""Michael may not be the smartest person. Heck, he might even be an idiot. But he got the manager job because he is a good salesmen. And a good salesmen is a good negotiator."""
Jim smiles towards the end is soo deep... He was one of the main reason for this
"""I know its a Tv show. but, how?! how did Michael get it done? I'm honestly shocked"""
I love how the first two times they have their jackets off but after having to leave the room again and again they just leave them on because they know they'll probably ask for the room again.
One of the best scenes in TV history.
Even David was low key proud when he heard that from Michael 1:10
"""The smooth chest optimally battle because course aetiologically depend regarding a raspy road. ragged, natural surfboard"""
It’s amazing how Michal can be the biggest idiot and then randomly turn in to the smartest man in the room
Michael Scott is goated man. Like when he was serious nobody could stop him. Top 10 fictional character of all time
"""The only one who benefited from Michael and Pam quitting, was Ryan. He got his job back.

He really is the best salesman
"""Love Pam's reaction when he says """"No"""""""
Michael Scott is a god of paper
"""Also when Michael couldn't pocket a client from the best salesman, he pocketed the salesman."""
It kills me how he suddenly develops amazing business acumen then turns around and is a doofus again.
The only comedy show I rated 10/10.
Michael is a hidden genius and the best salesman. He acts the fool but his branch is by far the best performing.
Its like Donald Trump lol
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads
both Pam and David are proud of Michael  1:06
Micheal can be scary when he’s serious. The only times I actually liked him were in parts like this. He was wise in this
"""WAIT!!!! They edited out the ABSOLUTE BEST part of this exchange! Watch the original, Michael totally shuts down David Wallace like a total badass."""
I would've taken the 60.000$ and created another company to steal more clients from dunder mifflin then they would have to offer more money to buy the company and the cycle would repeat to the point where the company would turn into a successful business
"""This was Michael being an absolute genius. 
I feel like this is the Michael that is often hidden behind the silliness."""
Thanks to Jim really
You think this is peak humor until you watch the Peep show
Our balls are in your court 🤣🤣
"""The thing about Michael Scott is that you never felt like you were working FOR him, you felt like you were working WITH him. As a part of a family, which provides a comfort and closeness that allowed his employee's natural talents to flourish. That's why his branch's were always successful.

"""David Wallace's my third favorite character

I don’t care if Ryan murdered his whole family he is like a son to me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ending sounds like they were clapping pamela’s cheeks for excitement
Very awesome show.
Michael is actually so fucking smart
im glad he pulled it off. good for him
One of Michaels greatest moves ever!
Kelly puts a cup against the wall lmao instead of just her ear against the wall
@4:52 you can see Creed is hard at work  playing spider solitaire 😆
"""Ah yes, the negotiator."""
"""Watched this scene with my family. When Scott mentioned the """"Various companies he could make"""" my father stopped the episode and proceeded to talk about how Michael only seems like a goofball, but will be the best boss you could wish if it's needed.

"""It's as if God blesses Michael Scott in spite of his deficiencies. He gets to enjoy many beautiful women in an intimate way. The company continues to do business in spite of big name competitors. And when it's all said and done, his subordinates really seem to have a genuine love for him."""
60.000 needs approval but a couple of millions are okay lol
2:48 Probably my favorite part of the whole clip.😂
I laughed at the title...
That could be the best thing I've ever seen.

"""David Wallace’s respect for Michael has both increased and decreased at the same time.

I don’t know how, but it just has. Michael gains respect here and then loses it somewhere else and then gains it back later.

0:55 the moment David knew Michael had him by the balls lol
Trump2020!! Keep America great!! 🇺🇸👊🏽✊🏽 Vote in person!

Our balls are in your court! 🤣
Michael is a fucking genious. Its only when the cameras are rolling that he acts stupid to seem funny or cool
English..? yeah BIG TIME
I always liked the respect between David and micheal. David was the only one who saw beyond all his antics.
No matter how stupid Michael is but the way he deal  is  outstanding 👌👌👌
Michael actually seemed smart in this scene
The single most impressive thing Michael Scott ever did
I would go to any limits to have a boss like that
Even Pam was so impressed with Michael
Our balls are in your coat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"""You can tell David is fuming inside at 4:18, I love it."""
Our balls are in your court 😂😂
Yeah because a company infinitely larger than The Michael Scott Paper company couldn’t just undercut them
"""""""our balls are in you court"""" omg I literally peed my pants laughing"""
I love Wallace.
Possibly my favorite Michael Scott moment ever. When he negotiates and David says “okay.”
"""The moment Pam smiles at the camera, like she's so proud of Michael, is amazing."""
Super unrealistic
I love how Michael desperately tries to act like the top negotiator
The only one time Michael is Brilliant but this is the most brilliant moment of the whole series
"""This scene is so different from the regular Office but damn. Impressive, suspenseful, and exhilarating! Even though it's seen this before, I had a big relief at the end just like they did."""

"""Let's not forget, Jim also helped in saving MSPC,"""
"""I wouldn’t mind if Michael was my boss honestly because he actually cares about his employees and the customers rather how much money will be in his pocket at the end of week and that’s the kind of boss you want to have, not a boss who only hires you to fill his bank account"""
THIS alone is why US version is superior to the UK version.
1:07 I love Pam's smile here. She's genuinely proud of Michael.
This whole scene is brilliant
Broo this had me jumping left and right when I first saw this it was good goddddd
One of the things I really appreciate about the US version of the show is the character evolution of Michael Scott.. they managed to take a one note character and really flesh him out. Very smart writing.
"""""""That's insultingly low. I don't even want to hear your first offer"""" Michael and his gem of a line🤣🤣🤣"""
"""I know that this is a comedy but those tactics also work in a real world. I love how they portrayed michael over this series. Kind of idiotic but when it comes to sales or in this case, negotiation, he becomes a wizard"""
I'd forgotten just how good this scene was. Just brilliant.
"""this was the heart of his argument and the heart of the show, really. a business is about more than the numbers/valuation (david) or how hard you can get people to work (charles), it's about the relationships you have with the people you work with, whether they're your co-workers or your clients. at the end of the day that was the most powerful force of all. guys like CFOs have to answer to numbers but michael has to answer to people and in a weird way that job is much, much more complex and rewarding. his skill gives him all the leverage in the world"""
Our balls are in your court 😂😂😂
I always interpreted that when Wallace says Michael and Michael says that’s one of them. I thought I was a play on words for “Mike Co”
Wow!
This show has some of the best writing a tv show has ever had.
"""Well well well, how the turntables."""
"""""""Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?""""

If someone asked Michael this, he would find some way to argue that the fish was a better deal."""
You can tell David likes Michael and cares for him
So Charles Miner is very valuable. Did anyone else see him bring any value to this meeting?
"""Wallace: $12000
Michael: **negotiates**
Wallace: $60000

Ah yes, the negotiator."""
"""""""¿Wouldn't you rather a fishing pole than a fish?"""".

"""The """"hmm"""" after David offered 60k😅😅😅"""
Charles is like a second Ryan
That was actually pretty impressive
"""This has to be Michael’s “big brain” moment. Like even I didn’t think about more than a $60,000 buy out."""
Remember how in LOVE Angela was with Charles?
"""Michael Scott said it best when he said, """"'You miss 100% of the shots you don't take' - Wayne Gretzky""""."""
"""Michael is a the world's best salesmen. That's why they keep him as a manager, as whilst he may be a bufoon, he knows how to sell paper."""
I love it when Pam smiled at Micheal in this scene
Can we appreciate how pretty that smile is 1:06
"""Highlight is """"our balls are in your court""""..."""
I love David Wallace.
"""He reminds me of George Washington.  Sure George owned slaves, but damn he founded a country.  I'll give my full support for this slave owner for all of eternity!"""
Hilarious 🤯
This is the moment when we realized that Michael is a badass
"""Yes he's talking about a multi million dollar buyout but that money isn't just going down the drain, they're gaining 3 employees and putting a top competitor out of business."""
he promoted Pam and Rehired Ryan in under 2 minutes. Absolute legend.
The best boss ever! 💪🏼
1:09 Pam looks so proud
The moment Ryan admired Michael the most
"""I've always liked David Wallace's character. I know this was Michael's time to shine but David was extremely patient and genuinely considerate to Michael given the circumstances. Yeah his motivations might have been more profit driven, but that's not a bad thing. The fact that he accepted Michael's proposal means that money isn't everything to him."""
I love how Michael protects Ryan even after everything he has done.
"""He was just playing another one of his characters
' *Business MIKE* '"""
"""""""We are so rich"""""""
I love this episode. It was so refreshing to see Michael as a competent businessman and not just a bumbling idiot
"""People often say Michael is a “horrible boss”. I honestly don’t know why. Every other branch falls short of his and you can’t say it’s just about sales. 

Take a look at the Stamford branch. Their ‘amazing boss’ walked out on them and caused gigantic problems for head office. Jim himself said Michael would never do this. 

Let’s talk about Jim for a second. He’s the person that once said “I can’t see this being my career” yet he still works there. They ALL do. Huh..seems strange.

Yeah sure, he hosts silly parties, he forms sentences in odd ways and is not always work appropriate. But he’s a great leader, motivator and very charismatic. He quite literally strong-armed Dunder Mifflin into a multi million dollar buyout. 

Don’t underestimate this guy just to jump on the bandwagon."""
Jim was the hidden hero here.
"""I love his Ewok sounding """"Shush up"""" sound at 2:48 lmao"""

"""I wish all bosses I’ve encountered are like Michael.. The one who cares a lot, and kind of stupid at the same time. 😂"""
"""I love the family dynamic between those 3.

The best moments from The Office are the ones where Michael is the smartest/kindest/most sincere guy in the room.

He could be smart sometimes.
"""David Wallace: Your company cannot be worth that much.

Micheal: Our company is worth nothing!

Truer words have never been spoken. Thank goodness he didn't stop there. Oh Michael 😂😂😂"""
"""A lot of people view Micheal as a kind of sales savant/general idiot but I think the unspoken truth of his character is that he has adult ADHD, and outside of the more heavy satire it's actually a fairly realistic depiction. There are THOUSANDS of companies where the best salesmen make more money than their managers, but just don't have the organization or the emotional stability to manage other people effectively. That's why there are plenty of nominal v.p or executive positions that reflect competence, but don't come with any real management responsibility. The warrant officer position in the military is actually a perfect example of this. Specialists are promoted to it because they're good at their jobs, but that competence often doesn't translate to managerial competence. Micheal is a perfect example of someone who was promoted to an administrative position when they should have just been promoted to a title-holding sales position that didn't require them to manage other people. It's not that Micheal is an idiot/sales savant, he's just an excellent salesman with skills that don't translate to management. He's smart, he's just a different kind of smart."""
Michael is really Genuis Man When he want to be

Michael low-key is an AMAZING negotiator when he's really backed into a corner.
This was the last good arc of the series IMO. Everything after this just started going downhill.
"""Best part of this episode is the ending...

Charles: Hey, guys–
Michael: No, no. You’re done"""
Michael was so incredibly LOYAL!!!
But he wasnt able to fire creed..
The office went straight down when Michael left
"""Something I really appreciated about this show was that the fact Michael was branch manager actually made sense. Sure, he goofed around... A LOT, but he knew what he was doing. His main skill was making a random group of people feel like family, and every damn time his sales skills got put to the test, he was the best of the bunch. I really cannot express how much I loved that."""
Ah yes the negotiator
One of them really look like Idris Elba.
Nice Eyes!!!
"""I actually enjoyed that episode, I never understood why they often made the characters so crazy? Some episodes were unwatchable because of it. Sure create funny situations but they often crossed the lines of reality in regards to humanisms."""
0:25 what the grown ups in the world peanuts sounded like
Michael was great
"""3:29 “I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family, he is like a son to me” 😂😂"""
Dude I bet that moments like this is how Michael even has a manager position to begin with XD
"""I always liked David and how he puts up with Michael because his branch delivers. I feel like this is one of the moments he understands Michael is not a bumbling idiot full time. He tried to have Michael explain how his branch was profitable on more than one occasion, but he had to experience it here."""
The writers on this show are next level genius. And the casting is 👏🔥😚🥰
Did it ever say why Michael likes Sebrings so much?😂😂
"""Michael basically just shat on every salesperson ever. There is a level to badassery that he made unreachable. When he goes on a sales call with Jan, we witnessed a finesse in sales. This guy is a genius. If he had actual financial planning, could have set up a company worth millions"""
Michael thinks hes so cool. I could totally outsell him.
Admit it you smiled when Pam smiled
That Jim smile in the end
Whenever I think Michael has finally got it...then he doesn’t...Then he does!   LOL 😂
"""This is American comedy, the protagonist is a winner no matter what."""
"""“I don’t care about if Ryan murdered his entire family, he is like a son to me”"""
Why was him cutting off David when David goes “Michael.” An absolutely amazing sales tactic?
"""""""I'll see your situation and I'll raise a situation"""" 
I love Michael"""
Our balls are in your court ... Lmao
We are sooooo rich!
"""Michael: """"I want Pam and I to have our jobs back."""" 
David: """"Ok.."""" 
Michael: """"And Ryan."""" 
David: *Flips*"""
"""Michael Scott is the biggest idiot, but at the same time one of the most amazing salesmen’s."""
I'd like to see a Conversation between Michael Scott and Karl Pilkington
"""""""I would rather have $60,000 honestly.""""

Like wow. Millennials are the worst kind of people ever. Sucks to be them."""
i’m so proud of michael
Our balls are in your court. Man Michael is awesome.
"""After watching this clip, I am really glad! I have never wasted any more of my life by watching a whole episode of this garbage! it took all my will power to stay 5 minutes with this humourless, poorly acted nonsense!"""
Dang Michael Scott is the smartest dumb guy in TV history LOL
Okay
Micheal can be annoying at times. But there is a unique quality in him that kept him manager of Scranton branch. Excellent salesmanship
David Wallace is so good looking😋
Our ball's in your court 😂
"""Yeah, I just need to binge the series again. This clip did it."""
"""Why didn’t they take the 60k divide it up and go get new jobs? They would’ve gotten salaries, benefits at other companies and by that point they would’ve had a pretty good resume since they had just founded and sold a subsidiary company of a paper giant. I feel like they just wasted 60 grand"""
Michael Scott. One of the best characters of tv history
"""The face of michael when he heard 60,000 😂"""
"""Writers really cheated the whole character thing here
It looks great that Micheal outsmart others 
But they should have written it keeping the whole balance of his IQ."""
"""Am I the only one who had a heart attack when Michael said """"our company is worth nothing"""" as if he was spilling the beans 😂😬"""
Wow 60 Gs I’m buzzed
Probably the best scene in the series. How can someone so dumb be so clever at the same time? I guess knowledge is power.
“We are so rich” 😂🤣
"""That’s nothing...
I once saw him Michael Scott make a million $ sale, and all he did was say his name.
You truly miss all the shots you don’t take 
As said by Wayne Gretzky... Via Michael Scott"""
Lol
I have no shortage for company names XD
Every so often I just research this episode fully just for this scene so thank you for uploading it
We are so rich 😂
How come Wallace can give them jobs but needs approval for a mere 60k?
Michaels idiocy is his super effective double edged sword
Looks like Stringer's really moved up from running that copy store.
Dafuq is idris elba doing here XD hahahha
This is why Michael Scott is a manager a lot of people underestimate him but he’s a genius when it comes to sales and negotiating. Another perfect example is when he made that sale without Jan at chilis
1:06 there was some attraction and respect towards Michael in Pam's eyes.
"""Michael forced David into a position to twice insist he wouldn't fire Charles to give him (Michael) the upper hand going forward with the negotiations. Michael knew he had his job back at that point. Next, Charles probably makes close to six figures a year, so Michael's leverage was insisting they rehire Pam for probably half of what they're paying Charles. Easy win. Ryan was the wildcard, but David knows the company would never allow Ryan to even attempt to climb the corporate ladder again and would be earning even less than Pam, so it was a pretty even deal, leaning slightly in Michael's favor. That's why David and Charles slinked away at the end - they got outbid by a person they both thought was a complete idiot. Michael's """"smart"""" moments are my favorite parts of the show."""
"""""""I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family, he's like a son to me"""" 🤣🤣🤣

Michael loved Ryan, even more than he loved Holly."""
Well Well Well How The TurnTables
So no-one gonna mention that Idris Elba sitting there? Lol
What a dude Micheal Scott is! You think this guy would not survive a tough negotiation situation but boom!
"""When you get into a tight situation like this at work, you want Michael Scott on your side giving out the demands"""
Micheals great when he’s competent. He’s also great when he’s incompetent
2:48 Chop chop :D I’m laughing hard!
"""From selling drugs to selling paper.
Way to go Stringer 😂"""
"""Ladies and Gentlemen, the greatest salesman of all time Micheal Scarn... Oh yeah Micheal Scott... That's what she said"""
"""You are in the best position to win an argument, when you have nothing to lose."""
"""I'll admit, when I first saw this scene, I expected Michael to completely screw up the negotiation. No lie, my jaw literally dropped when he actually made a serious, intelligent effort to negotiate. My respect for him increased exponentially."""
This is by far my favourite scene of the entire show. Pure brilliance on Michael’s part
Wonderful moment.
"""Michael : If tomorrow the paper company goes down, I'll just start another, and another, and another. I have no shortage of..

No one:

Michael:.. company names.

Me: 🤣🤣🤣"""
High IQ Michael is the best
Don’t forget the chili’s client miracle
Entertaining!
“I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family! He is like a son to me!” One of the most underrated line in the office.
They way Pam looks at Michael. All proud 😊
Just like with the traveling salesman this reminds you that Micheal is legendary at selling paper
World’s Best Boss
This has to be one of the best scenes in the show. We finally get to see Michael be a professional
Andy Buckley was amazing in The Office. He played his role very well.
OKAY SO LIKE ANYONE ELSE EXPECTED A BOOM ROASTED FROM MICHAEL SCOTT TOO?
LOVE LOVE LOVED this episode!
Michael is a horrible manager but a great salesman. Like Dwight.
I love how they show Michael successful too.
"""I’m so glad I get to relive everything through the comments,  as if that adds to what I’ve literally just watched."""
Michael Scott is the greatest salesman of all time
camera man be like *ZOOOOOOM*
Fave scene in all the office
I wonder how much does Michael Scott gets paid for playing Steve Carrel.
0:49 When the dumbest person you know says the smartest thing you've ever heard
"""Did you guys know, that when the office writers went on strike. Steve Carell joined in and called in sick for enlarged balls. Lol I imagine the meeting going like this 0:49"""
"""I want a compilation of moments like these where Michael's competence shines. I'm thinking of this, the big client sale at Chili's, and the scene where he's against not having little paper cups at the water cooler because he can't use water trips as an excuse to check up on his employees. I'm sure there are others, too."""
This is my favorite Michael Scott moment
"""""""Are balls are in your court"""" LMAOO  i love that line so much😂😂😭"""
Always good to see Michael nail this.
David Wallace: one of the best straight men in tv history.
“Our balls are in your court” hahaha
"""I don’t like Kelley at all but, I think her “wah wuh wuhwah” line is hilarious."""
Best boss ever
"""""""I don't have to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I have to wait out you"""" My god, that was badass"""
We always get shocked when Michael does something really well. But that's because we always overlook the fact that michael is actually the best salesman in their branch. Even above Dwight. He's the one that got the branch all their largest accounts
CLEVER MIKE .
Best episode ever.
"""Ryan: exists

Michael: he's like a son to me"""
"""It was my dream episode..... Michael, Pam and Ryan happy together."""
"""“I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family, he’s likes son to me!” I spat my coffee, freaking genius one liner 😂😂"""
best show ever
Sometimes a teacher has to act stupid in order to make the other person feel smart and confident about themselves.
I love how this episode shows Michaels intelligence!
"""“Our balls are in your court”.
Yep"""
I kind of love and hate Michael at the same time 😂
Michael was running the most successful branch of the company. Leverage.
Our balls is in your court !!! LMAO 😂😂
I loved that side quest Michael did with Pam and Ryan
"""""""And dental this time"""" 🤣🤣🤣"""
"""Michael rarely gets things right, but when he did it's extremely satisfying."""
i have never seen a person wh have guts to do what miachael did here. I'd straight away taken those 12000 doller!
"""Michael """" Our balls are in your court""""😂"""
"""""""Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?"""" THAT is a pearl of wisdom."""
"""Gets offered $60,000 
Michael: “We are So,...rich.” 
😂😂😂"""
"""I thought he said,
""""Would you rather eat a fishing pole or a fish?""""
Which I think would've been a whole lot better than what was actually said!
OH! If you also enjoy The Office funny edits, stop by my """"Me and Michael"""" Video featuring all of Dwight and Michael throughout the series :)"""
"""At about 1:08, Michael Scott scores the best bj of his life from Pam that Jim never could."""
Love this scene!
Awesome stuff!! Jim’s final “Jim look” let’s you know just how much of a marionettist he is
"""David Wallace was so handsome and sexy. The time they showed him shirtless, I almost died. That manly hairy chest."""
4:33 - Love Charles’ face as he leaves the room. He knows he’s screwed
This is so satisfying to watch
"""I really don't know how after 15 years they still underestimating Michael,he passed at least 1/3 of his life on the company,and still David tries to make 15,000 only for the man that lead his most profitable branch fillial."""
Thanks to Jim for keeping Dwight out of the meeting.
The best part was “And I want Charles gone...”. I literally pumped my fist and yelled YES!
The greatest negotiator i have ever watched on the screen.
"""This moment, and the moment he went to some chain restaurant to get the local government contract, are the times you realise he's not a complete idiot and realise how he got to be manager in the first place."""
"""“Pam, I do my best work when people don’t believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. The very next day, I went out and scored more goals than anyone on the hockey team.”"""

This clip explains why Front Point partners at Morgan Stanley decided to hire Michael Scott to run their business in 2007 and allow him to execute the big short
"""David Wallace: I know this business, your company can't be worth that much.
Michael Scott: our company is worth nothing,These are our demands, Pippity poppity give me the zoppity"""
"""When it really comes down to business Michael is a genius, that's how he became the boss. He only acts like an idiot to boost team morale which clearly works since Scranton is consistently the highest performing branch."""
"""Without a doubt my FAVORITE Michael moment in the entire show. I love how this scene shows Michael's genius tactics combined with his care for his employees, which gets them the big deal. Best boss ever. 💪"""
I wish I could experience The Office for the first time again
No one could have played Michael Scott better than Steve Carell.
Only time Michael ever applied his mind in the right direction without being distracted.
That Kelly and Angela is so underrated. It cracks me everytime. Maybe just my level of sense of humor but it gets me everytime.
"""The elevator sequence just prior to this was pretty dang funny, too."""
This is one of those rare instances where Michael was smarter than everyone else in the room.
"""""""I have no shortage of company names"""" Michael's top priority, a company name😂😂😂"""
“Our balls are in your court”😂
Want a boss like Michael
"""Literally watched this episode for the first time last night, and I was ASTONISHED by this scene. I don't remember the last time I ran the gamut of emotions like that. Still can't believe it worked out xD"""
My all time favorite scene in The Office.
"""my favorite michael scott clapback everrrr: """"I think I just have to wait out..you"""""""
"""Gets there jobs back

*Calmly closes blinds*

Proceeds to celebrate 🎉😁🙌😂"""
David Wallace is honestly one of my favorite Office characters. He's always like a breath of fresh air every time he's on screen.
One of the best moments showing why Scott is THE BEST BOSS.
"""Just a quick reminder why Michael Scott, despite all of his antics, is the manager of the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin... That bluff to wait out David is a damn good line."""
This moment always gives me chills. XD
"""""""OUR balls in your court"""" I love that butchering of the phrase!"""
probably the best michael scott scene ive ever scene.
Our balls are in your court 😂😂
David is one of my favorite characters :)
David Wallace seems like a very understanding dad
Thank God for The office
"""True office fans will get this, what is kelly's middle name?"""
"""Michael Scott is what I hope to.....

So good at his job, he can screw up every week and still be untouchable"""
I was so happy when he undermined charles miner
Michael Scott is the proof that smart people can be morons
That 'I see a situation and raise you a situation' line is Oscar worthy.
"""""""Wouldn't you want a fishing pole rather than a fish?"""" smartest thing i ever heard him say"""
1:08 Pam is so proud
If anyone want to know what are Avalanches ? Just see Ryan's character he went  from newbie to manger to nothing to back in office 😀
"""This is my favorite portion of The Office. It's not hilarious but it's so epic, it gives me chills."""
One of the best spotlights on Michael's intelligence
0:23 😂
One of my favorite moments
"""When David left the room for the last time after the deal was completed you can tell he has a sense of respect from Michael, that slight smile, when he said yeah after being asked if they could have the room"""
You could make an hour long video of Michael Scott moments that warm your heart. Truly a top tier TV Boss.
I can’t be the only one that is curious about what the first offer was going to be.
I love how Pam is impressed with Michael's negotiation skills at 1:08
It's like the smartest Michael has ever been in his life an temp was just dumb
David Wallace was such a great and patient boss man lol putting up with someone like Michael is stressful and frustrating Lmfaoo. He was always really nice to Michael too and let him slide so many times.
Michael Scott is so smart until thing start going well
2:49 😂😂😂😂😂
David is just such a good guy!! I am happy he moved away from Suck It and into the thing he is.made for 😅
"""I respect Michael Scott so much.
1.Great Boss (he goofs off but he gets the job done and keeps the branch from closing!)
2.Has a real and genuine personality (He says things and does things to brighten the day!)
3.LOYAL (He has that never leave a man behind mentality that I respect so much!)
4. Really Cares ( When a boss really cares about their employees everyone feels like a team!)
5. Because he is him :)"""
One of my most favorite arcs in the series
Seeing Charles leave and Michael cutting him off while he tried to say goodbye to the office is one of the most oddly satisfying moments of the series.
"""I want a Sebring..
Charles: They dont make them anymore
...And I want Charles gone"""
This is legitimately the smartest Michael’s ever been on the show.
thats one of my fav scene
this show doesnt get enough credit for how many economic concepts it presents/twists in interesting and hilarious ways
"""“Ryan cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars”
“I don’t care if he murdered his entire family, he is like a son to me”
-Michael Scott"""
This is a good scene for so many reasons. This is way you take a raise over a bonus check. Bonuses aren’t guaranteed every year but a raise is usually constant and hardly ever goes down. Always take the fishing poll over the fish.
I love Competent Michael almost as much as Incompetent Michael.
It's not personal... it's just personal business.  Big difference. There is no one.. NO ONE... I would rather go to the mattresses with then Ryan.  Just yesterday he was helping me shop for mattresses. 😘😘😘
This is my favorite scene from this show called The Office. Felt so good to see Scott being super smart (for a change) lol
Michael is so badass in this episode
This is Michael Scott's most brilliant moment.
This was Michael’s greatest moment
"""One of my favorite Michael Scott moments. 
This and the moment at Chili’s where he gets the client. 

I love goofy, inappropriate Michael. However, it’s great to see him shine as a businessman & remind the audience how he got to the position he holds for most of the show."""
I think we can all agree that Charles was the worst. Like Robert California was better (I actually think that Micheal and Robert would be very entertaining if they happened at the same time).
Remember he was promoted to manager from salesman.
"""You see everyone is saying that Micheal was a brilliant salesman. And that is so true, But does anyone else see that Pam knows it too? The fact that she smiles shows that this is why she trusted him. And other things, too. She was the only one that left with him. She was the only one that belived in him in *many* situtions. (Also ignore my spelling its sucks I know)"""
wait cant michael just use that money to start another company to be more profitable? or is he offered that money to not attack dunder mifflin?
"""Finally, this is one of the best micheal moments in the show and it’s never been on YouTube until now"""
One of the most triumphant moments of The Office. Love it
"""The fact that Michael is actually this intelligent and this wise really makes you wonder about his entire character in subtle ways, what does it mean if he is capable of this kind of critical thinking? Why? What? How? ???"""
"""Others : Commenting exactly what the characters said and getting lots of likes.
Me : Woah. Now that’s a comment.
🤨😏"""
I sometimes doubted his ability in making a joke but never his skills in salemanship.
'My company is worth nothing!'  so epic
2:48 i love this noise Michael makes. I keep going back to listen to it.
Just added this to my playlist of happy videos that make my day better :D
Their victory is one of the most satisfying things I've ever watched
Never forget he is a great sellman after all
"""This was one of those rare moments where you see that Michael Scott was, in the words of Jim, """"a great boss"""".  It's when the Office veers back into the reality of daily office life for a time and reminds you of how great his character was."""
"""They should’ve had the deal close with Michael saying our balls our in your court then the scene cuts to David leaving the room and then Michael, Pam , and Ryan celebrating like how they did. It brings a sort of tension or small feeling that u might enjoy. Idk I’m not a director I shouldn’t know. 


Edit: would go like this: 4:10 - 4:18 then it cuts to 4:36"""
It's amazing how good he is at negotiating considering how stupid he is.
Michael was the smartest guy eventhough he acted like he was stupid
God this show is so good
I love how Michael implies that the only required thing to start a company is a name ^^
More like Gayvid Wallace
"""How could you do this to me Michael? You just cost me $60,000...😂😂😂"""
"""Goddamn sometimes i really wanna be like Michael. Being geeky stupid sometimes but actually has an incredible talent, like this for example and don't forget about when he caught Dwight betraying him about talking to jan"""
Top 10 Most Badass Moments in Anime
I love how he can be a shark sometime!!!
This is one my favorite sequences in the entire show. You see the whole breadth of Michael Scott as a leader right in these 5 minutes.
"""This proves how Michael was skilled enough for Manager position, he managed to secure 3 jobs and get way more than the company was actually worth"""
"""Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he's actually really smart"""
So Wallace says he's not sure if he can approve 60K.. but then agrees to a multi-million dollar deal? lol
"""Just a really awesome scene, peak Office was the Michael Scott Paper Company."""
4:48 me and my friends when my crush says she likes me back
Michael Scott might be the Dumbest but also Smartest Manager in the planet
Greatest salesman in “40 year old virgin” and greatest salesman in “The office”
David is a sexy man without even trying.  There is something about him.
Oh yeah yeah
“Wouldn’t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish “ wise words
"""""""Our balls are in your court"""" 😂😂"""
"""This is probably the smartest thing Michael has every said, “Would you rather a fishing pole or a fish.”"""
"""This, Chili's, and getting Danny Cordray to Dunder-Mifflin really show that he's THE best salesman Dunder-Mifflin ever had."""
The best think that I got from this was: “what do you hear?” “Hurrr murr ma murr moo ha man murr”
I love it when they showcase the smart side of Michael. He was a great negotiator!!
I mean the only thing gained back from before they left was Ryan really
His ideas are just better but btw guys sub to my channel pls
He didn’t get that best boss coffee mug for no reason!
Dental is important to Michael because he has soft teeth
Lmao what was Charles even doing he just turned his head randomly like every 12 seconds but literally didn’t do anything else
While watching the show i never thought of michael as being a badass....until this scene in this episode lol
Can we all appreciate that Jim played an essential role in making the deal happen in the first place
"""Andy Buckley (playing CFO David Wallace) was such a perfect fit to play senior level executive. His body language & acting was amazing throughout.


(Also, 1:07 Pam's smile!!!!!)"""
Michael's!never been smarter
"""Ah yes, the negotiator"""
I love the fact that Jim was happy for them. So wholesome
"""Idris Elba, man this show had some good cameos"""
"""This is supposed to be some brilliant maneuver by Michael, but all he did was get the job he quit back. He wouldn’t have even had to do anything if he had been calculated in the first place"""
At 0:25 Kelly sounds like the adults on Charlie Brown😂
Best. Negotiator. Ever.
"""And this is why Michael G Scott is manager of Dunder Mifflin bc of his amazing sales tactics and negotiations! He is incredibly kind, loving, and yes silly and goofy but that’s how you build morale and keep work fun! He loves his employees and knows the business!!!"""
"""For very important reasons, this is one of my favorite episodes of the show. It really highlighted that what Michael lacked in just about everything else...financial prudence, industry awareness, brand building, and even maintaining client relations when he had to go back and change their prices...he made up for in passion. He was never going to give up, and he was always going to be a problem for DM unless they hired him back. You want him on your team, not the other team"""
One of my fav office moments of all time
Whoever runs this account should upload a video of vikram. May he Rest In Peace
"""0:15 why do I get the feeling that $12,000 was actually their first offer and not the second one. I'm sure David knew Michael was just being Michael."""
One of the few times Michael shows that he only is a dolt when the cameras are on and he's getting spotlight attention.  There's a reason he's a stellar salesman.  He performs here and the scene where Jan and him nail the sale at the Chilis.  He's very competent in the right areas.
The scene with Kelly and Angela is so unexpected which is what makes it so funny
One of those moments that show just how great a salesman Michael Scott is.
"""one of my favorite scenes from the office, Michael Scott, a big brain."""
One of the best and underrated scenes ever in the entire series!
Love that David Wallace gave into Michael's demands knowing damn well Michael is more then petty enough to actually spend his time trying to get David fired and sink Dunder Mifflin lol
"""Michael should have won the """"Entrepreneur of the Century"""" award for that negotiation skills !! ❤️

And that look on Pam when he negotiates.. best moment ever ❤️❤️❤️"""
Easily one of the greatest moments throughout the entire show ♥️
Even though Michale is goofy he’s a great salesmen
Seeing Michael win and Charles lose is the most satisfying moment ever
Pam's smile at 1:09 defines the show more than anything that could be verbally said.
David overplayed his hand from $12k to $60k. Michael at this time knew he could get more.
"""So lets list everything they got back. 
Michael got his regional manager job
Pam got a sales job
Ryan got a sales job
They all got Health benefits (including dental), and social security.
That was a fantastic deal for them."""
"""‘That is surprisingly low’ HE SAID IT, HE SAID THE THING"""
Great to see that Stringer Bell finally got out of the streets of Baltimore and become the natural businessman he is. And even (David) Wallace is back!
This has got to be my favorite story arc in the show. Really deconstructs the whole Office story and characters and adds to the story in a really unique way.
Thanks to Jim too 😂😂
"""This is the kind of raw natural business wit you can’t learn in business school. 

Take notes, Ryan."""
"""Not only this was the smartest Michael ever got, this was also the smartest anyone in the office ever acted"""
"""I think Michael should have token the 20 k and left to go get another job lol, I mean he didnt make much as a manager for that company either way. I think it was best for him to take it unless he came up with another offer like a higher position in Dunder Mifflin he pretty got the job that didnt really offer much for him other then staying with friends lol."""
Buttlicker our prices have never been lower!
I imagine about 20 takes with the Angela and Kelly scene. 🤣
"""Micheal might be dumb 9 times out of 10 but that 1 time he's smart it counts :')
Also Pam's smile of approval was so sweet!"""
I love Wallace’s look at around 4:20. Just the realization that this total manchild has him outsmarted.
Probably Michael's most brilliant moment in the series.
"""""""I have no shortage of company names.""""
""""Michael-""""
""""That's one of them!""""
Just the delivery of that line is so perfect"""
"""anyone else binging the office clips?

no? just me?

okay."""
“Our balls are in your court” LOL
"""For all his flaws, michael is actually portrayed as a great salesman in many occasions. And a great negotiator in this episode."""
I just realized now that Michael wanted dental benefits because he has soft teeth
Steve Carrell took ghe role in that Netflix show that makes a mockery out of the US Military.  I call on all veterans and patriots to not watch the show. He is better as Michael Scott and the 40 year old virgin
Micheal was like Micheal Jordan of sales in season 5
Jim’s little smile at the end made me so happy. He knew it went well.
like a BOSS
We are so rich
"""""""I am so impressed by the potential you see in me! """"


Michael Scott's evaluation by David Wallace"""
I like how the show allowed Michael to flex his intelligence and capabilities. Otherwise him being regional manager or even keeping his job would be entirely unbelievable.
"""Micheal may not be the smartest or easiest to like, but he knows business in a way that many others don't. He prioritizes relations over profit and when he said he could easily rebuild his paper company, I have no doubt he could. Simply through his connections and a likable business man."""
*MY FAVOURITE MICHEAL MOMENT HANDS DOWN. HE'S SUCH A BADASS IN THIS*
Sometimes not the best manager. But sometimes a brilliant salesman.
"""Well, well, well, 
How the turntables......."""
"""""""Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under I will just start another paper company."""" 
-Michael Scott

One of my favorite lines from him"""
"""Michael at his finest and most competent. Not only did he secure the deal, he looked out for his own people and made sure they got a better deal than anything they were expecting and they all walked away with more. Even though David apparently loses a lot of money on this deal, he knows that Michael's branch has always delivered and will continue to deliver for as long as he gets to be manager there so in the long term, Michael would make him money."""
How can someone be so intelligent yet so dumb and immature
How to get likes: *Creed*
"""As much as I love David Wallace, I don't think agreeing to his demands was good work as a CFO on his behalf."""
"""Michael:  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company and then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names. 
David Wallace:  Michael! 
Michael:  That's one of  'em!"""
Michael was smart whenever he needed to.
The fact that Charles was a yes-man was the reason he didn't prevent Wallace from making such a deal. Any other person and he woul have stopped Wallace. I love how realistically they handled this storyline.
In its hay day 🤣😄😂
This is one of my favourite scenes. You think hes goofy and gets by on his humour but hes also really smart
"""""""I have no shortages of company names""""
""""Michael..""""
""""That's one of them!"""""""
1:08 The smile on Pam's face just shows how proud she is of Michael
"""Ah yes, the negotiator"""
"""This is a rare opportunity for Micheal, getting to stand up, roast and to sass to his ex boss"""
So never listen to anyone’s first offer just go straight to the 2nd offer
Smartest guy in the Office
Michael actually really handled the negotiation well... He was able to get an unbelievable deal.
"""Finally, I've been waiting for this clip. It really shows how good Micheal is, why he's the boss."""
Well Well Well.... How the Turn Tables....
I love how Jim prevents Dwight from telling to David that Michael's company is failing.
PLEASE UPLOAD THE PART WHEN MICHAEL EXPLAINS HOW HIS BRANCH IS THE MOST PROFITABLE OF ALL....PLEASE
Michael Scott was low-key so smart
"""Pam (softly): """"Can you give us another minute, please?""""  One of the funniest and best-delivered lines in the whole series."""
"""And that's the answer to the question everyone's been asking the whole time: why is Michael the manager of Dunder Mifflin. He may seem stupid, but he's a *brilliant* salesman. He knows his client, he respects his employees, and even though it seems here that he makes some irrational decisions, he in fact knew that he could get more."""
"""YES

SERIOUS MICHAEL IS EVERYTHING"""
Michael isn't my favourite character but this scene just made my heart melt
"""I feel like Michael has multiple personalities, some days his IQ becomes over 12297379464694964 some days he just not as high IQ"""
If you notice Michael and the gang actually applies the rule of dominance in a room which he says in an earlier season (dont remember the name) something about where they lean their backs.
That was one heck of a negotiation fair play michael
I like the office
"""The smile on Pam's face at 1:08 is so gratifying - she knows under all of Michael's quirks and faults at the office, he has a great business sense buried underneath it all."""
"""The show after the first season did a job of making Michael a little more relatable, sympathetic and competent.  Much more complex and interesting. This clip shows that while he is often foolish, occasionally he can read the situation perfectly and deal with it, which made him a great salesman. 1/10 times he will win a battle and that will save his job."""
"""""""There are certain defining moments in a person’s life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don’t even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.""""

-Michael Scott"""
He could look like an idiot but when it comes to sales he is the best💵👨‍💼
"""""""Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl, and I, took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more than just salary. It's about, perks. Like having sex with Jan.""""

- Michael Scott"""
One of my fav Micheal Scott scene :’)
"""When Michael sits down and gives them logic, I seriously cheered. This is one of my favorite segments of this entire show. 
For once Michael.... wasn't Michael lol."""
"""“I don’t care if Ryan murders his whole family, he’s like a son to me!”






R.I.P Michael Scott"""
I love episodes like this that show how good Michael is so it compensates for his inappropriate actions.
This is one of Michael's most badass moments
"""I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family, he’s like a son to me
Michael Scott"""
"""Michael handled it perfectly.
He got everything he wanted mostly.
I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family - he is like a son to me"""
"""I don’t think I have to wait out Dunder Mifflin, I think I just have to wait out you. 

Greatest. serious. michael line. ever!!"""
"""""""Our balls are in your court."""" - The great Michael Scott."""
100th like :D
Steve Carell fit this role perfectly.
Trump literally became rich and the president from reading somehow I manage.
Michael is smart deep down
When your mum offers you a fiver to clean the entire house: 0:17
Yeah. Icheal
Michael was really smart in business and he is so funny and a friend to everyone
"""10 views, 16 likes, let's get it"""

"""Micheal Scott, the greatest salesman of all time."""
Love the office
"""Lol Michael is just dumb luck.
