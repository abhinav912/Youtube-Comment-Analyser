the negotiations were short...
"""Sometimes, watching The Office makes me think what I was doing with my life when they were making this."""
"""Michael's IQ about anything 30

Michael is a very gifted negotiator
"""How can Michael bugle his way through so much stuff, but completely knock this one out of the park."""
By his logic hiring any employee is a multi-million dollar buyout
Michael is smupid
Who else heard gru at 4:52 when Michael said can you believe it
"""I never got the ending here
Did they get 60k and Jobs or just jobs ?"""
Did anyone hear at 1:45 steve
Ah the negotiator

David was such an underrated character
Michael Scott is the warren buffet of sales ... hands down
Our balls are in your court - Michael Scott 2008
A multimillion dollar buyout for 3 people. They must be getting paid BANK at Dunder Mifflin
Maybe next time they’ll estimate Michael.

Michael just finessed them
The Negotiation is shorter than I expected...
Is that idris elba
I think he’s gonna have a lot harder time explaining to the shareholders why he just paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to sort out a mid level manager
Remember when Stanley asked the cameras if Michael was some sort of secret genius.
They should have take the money and buy bitcoin
Jim's influence on this is underrated. They could've got nothing in the end if he didn't step in
Michael Scott is the boss we secretly want but can never have.
