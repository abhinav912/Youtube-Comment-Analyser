It’s kind of harsher in hindsight when you realize Michaels stealing clients and causing this massive buyout that possibly brought Dunder Mifflin to bankruptcy later.
Jim swallowing his pride to sabotage Dwight's sabotage of the merger is amazing in this arc. Unfortunately skipped in this clip
"""When Michael Scott focuses, not even the president can refuse his offer."""

I was holding my breath wishing for Michael not to say anything stupid this entire session

Me: 👀"""
Realize Ryan didnt cheer at the end. Ego
My favorite episode of Mad Men.
I kid you not this scene makes me cry every time I watch through the show. 😂
Micheal is the literal definition of a dangerous fool.
You know how Superman disguises himself as Clark Kent to fit in with the common people. I feel miachel is the same. Only difference- he disguises himself as the stupidest person on earth.
They should make a movie about Micheal Scott stuck in an island.
idris elba ruined the office
I don't care if ryan murdered his entire family he's like a son to me

Kelly’s imitating what they say killed me 🤣
back here to fill the void after watching michael leave
Did no one notice when david said it would be a multi million dollar buyout? I seriously doubt the salaries of 2 salespeople and 1 manager at a paper company would ever be that much
This reminds me of Liar Liar when Fletcher wins his case
I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family. He's like a son to me!

"""I dont care if he murdered his whole family, hes like a son to me -- what a line."""
"""Technically Michael's strategy of constantly starting new paper companies to take away steal Dunder Mifflin clients wouldn't work after the second or third new company because the clients would stop supplying Michael soon enough due to the fact he wouldn't have the money to continue operations and buy more paper. Undercutting Dunder Mifflin makes his company lose money, and so every business would just go under. Eventually, suppliers, knowing of the inconsistent nature and lack of money to pay for their products that Michael has, would stop committing to his businesses and instead go back to Dunder Mifflin, a far safer, more reliable buyer who would actually be able to pay every order and order large supplies of paper (more business and profit for the suppliers)"""

Are we all gonna ignore that Michael finessed this situation
1:48 PAM SAID STEVE 😧😧😮😮
Both Smart And Stupid
"""David: How about 60,000 dollars?
Michael: *dead inside*"""
"""David was being overtly nice to Michael here. Maybe he felt like he owed Michael something. I mean think about logically, you’re one of Michael Scott paper companys clients right now and they go bankrupt within a week. So you go back to Dunder mifflin. Then next week Michael comes back to you next again trying to sell paper again under a newly created company name just a week after? No one in their right mind would sign with Michael again. You just literally saw his unreliability. David should’ve let the Michael Scott paper company bankrupt themselves and he would’ve gotten all the clients back without paying a dime"""
Motivation overload!!
Chaos method
Am I the only one who kind of hated Michael for attacking Dundee mifflin and stealing their clients?
There's no reason why he is the Regional Manager Of Dunder Mifflin.

Michael has so many stupid and weird ideas that when he comes up with something logical everyone looks at him like a genius
You must be having a bad day to dislike this video. To 98 people that dumbs down this video I hope your day gets better.
"""Hey CFO, buying a company for $0 and then absorbing their employees is not a multi million dollar buyout, idiot. It's called acquiring a company for payroll, which is as cheap as acquiring a company gets. Maybe Michael Scott is not actually the dumbest guy at the company. You are not giving them millions of dollars, they are working for you and you are paying them for their time."""
The writers blew it. There should of been an employee discount for paper which Micheal exploited. It extended to end of the month of his termination with no limit set. He could of bought at a loss to Dunder Miflin and resold at a profit
"""""""I don't care if he murdered his entire family, he is like a son to me.""""  Ya gotta give it up for that one."""
Savage asf
Charles was such an arrogant pos.

If Dweight didnt sound so stupid before this meeting it wouldnt have gone Michael's way ....
"""In all seriousness, this is the American Sitcom version of goku mastering Ultra Instinct and destroying Jiren"""
Michael’s consistent defense of Ryan is the worst part about him.
"""The one thing that was the most annoying is how all the salesman were rude to Ryan

"""Ryan low key admitting he would steal the $60,000 and leave town."""

The #1 moment where everyone severely underestimated Michael
"""Michael is the Goku of selling paper in the northeast, great at what he does but a moron at everything else"""
Only Micheal Scott could make a multimillion dollar profit from something that was absolutely worthless.
This scene alone explains why Michael was chosen as Scranton's Manager.
If Ryan did murder his whole family and he is basically Michelle’s son. Michelle should run
"""This is the reason why Charles Miner was the worst manager I've ever seen. By not acceding to Michael's simple demands, he set a whole series of events into motion, that ended up with the branch losing sales and DM having to spend money to get back two employees who left the company and one which they didn't even want back. Remember that rundown he had Jim do? Horrible communication skills.

There's a reason why Michael was more qualified to run the branch than Charles was."""
I don’t care if Ryan killed his entire family !
Is it weird that I just watched this episode last night?
Lets appreciate Jim too who didnt let Dwight inform Charles about their broke situation...!!!
It’s so sad that this show ended 🥺
"""Damn, how can Michael be so smart yet so dumb?"""
they had no idea how high he could fly
"""Everybody: Never accept the first offer.
Micheal: I don't wanna even here the first offer."""
Wallace’s smile at 1:10 in my opinion is a similar reaction to the one Pam had after michael finished talking. It was brief but in that moment he realizes exactly why Michael was the one chosen to run the branch & he’s not the Buffoon he or other makes him out to be so and immediately he realizes he can’t lowball him
"""David : How about 60,000 dollars ?

Michael might be a moron he is a damn good salesman
"""Michael Scott is that kid who never played Street Fighter 2 before, chose Zangief, and somehow still managed to beat you because he just mashed the buttons the whole time and ends up pulling off a few spinning pile-drivers.

Damn micheal is a god I negotiation
How he negotiated contains so many business principles in several disciplines. It goes to show that he's lazy most of the time but a genius when the situation really calls for it.
