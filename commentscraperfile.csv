"This entire episode was masterfully written.
Despite the fact that Scranton was the most profitable branch under Michael's command, David gradually lost his trust in him due to his antics, to the point where he infiltrated Charles as a potential replacement for him given his resume.
But all of this negotiation worked for David both as a solution to the crisis caused by Michael Scott's Paper Company and as a reaffirmation of confidence in Michael's ability to lead the branch.
David had preferred Charles because of his education and his ""focus on results"", however when Charles found himself in direct competition with Michael, he couldn't figure out how to counteract the attack of Michael's company, he also showed poor judgment when choosing Dwight as his right-hand man instead of Jim, just because of his personal dislike for him. Not to mention that at the negotiation table he didn't contribute anything valuable and showed that he didn't even have a complete overview of the critical situation of Scranton branch.
On the other hand, Michael showed mettle and iron negotiating skills, as well as his loyalty (he could have asked for more benefits for himself and left Pam and Kevin to their fate) and a sense of protection and empathy towards his subordinates (subtle details such as when he tells Pam and Kevin that it is the ""saddest day of his life"" and is still willing to listen to Pam's ""sad comment"" and Kevin's confession).
Charles can be the guy who ""focuses on results"", but ultimately delivers poor ones. On the contrary, Michael is the kind of manager who believes that fostering a good work environment, building subordinates' confidence in their own abilities, and working on jovial and close relationships with clients, will lead to good results in the long run (he showes this during the whole episode and in the end he reaffirm this point in his negociation closing), not to mention that when it comes to of critical negotiations, he becomes a master and the leader he is expected to be (upon deciding he wants to ""trade the fish for the fishing pole"" he discusses the idea with Pam and Kevin, but when he reaches consensus he shuts them up with authority and determination).
Of course I am aware that he was broke, but I never said he was a good entrepeneur, instead he is an accomplished and capable manager."

David knew he was screwed and was hoping Michael didn't know (by this point in the series, the CFO of a company would already know their company model was not sustainable).  Michael hit the nail on the head without even knowing that David was one wrong move away from being replaced as CFO for *years*. 

I mean we all like David, but Dunder-Mifflin was *literally* going under for a long time, and David IS THE CFO.  He's a likable character but doesn't that make it mostly his fault?  Assuming the CEO/Board wasn't strangling any good decision-making power he had?"

In the end David Wallace was the richest guy at The Office
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"I think this is one of the reasons why David has put up with all of Michael's antics. Not only because Mr. Wallace himself has patience, but also because he's seen and knows of Michael's capability. He knows that under that huge layer of foolishness, and immaturity, there's a great salesman somewhere lost underneath. That salesman isn't always present but when that inner salesman comes out wonders could happen. Like the meeting at Chilli's with the other guy and Jan. 

Some of you might argue that no this is only because of Mr. Wallace's patience. One could only be patient if they know or feel some smidge of success. When someone knows there will be no chance of success a person will have zero tolerance for that. Likewise Mr. Wallace knows Michael is capable and because of that is willing to be patient with him."

4:12 So Michael DID pull off his lean back move to showcase dominance which he couldn't do with Darryl haha!
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
The fact that they knew Michael would keep going and going until he found success made him a big risk and possible competition!! Michael was a top salesman with them and they knew he had what it took to be successful
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"The problem with Michael's strategy of simply starting a new company over and over to pressure Dunder Mifflin is that nobody is going to do business with any of these new companies after the first failure. The people who got burned by his impossible prices beforehand won't do business with Michael again, regardless of the new name he gives the company, and it wouldn't take long for word-of-mouth to spread to other potential businesses he might seek out. Unless he plans to keep a failing business afloat through his own personal funds (which he clearly can't), his strategy really doesn't make any sense - even if only as a bluff. Love the show, but David falling for this always kind of rubbed me the wrong way"

This whole ordeal was amazing, the way he negotiated so tactfully, and especially the way he truly looked out for friends by not taking the easy way out (the $60,000). The best part is that right before this, he was absolutely sure that he was going to blow it and give up the fact that his company was broke, but he turned it around so masterfully that he got them all better than what they had before.

This is where Michael Scott's genius really got to shine. I had never, ever been prouder of him than in this episode, and I'm so thankful he got this moment."

Michael is needy, childish and innapropriate, but he knows how to make a buck (even if he himself doesn't consciously understand the entire process) even in a declining industry. David doesn't understand why that is, but he knows it is so. Charles, however, is a prodigy at management, but, in his methodism and perfectionism, he hates how disfunctional (and often toxic) that environment is, so he could never really accept the fact that, for better or for worse, the whole thing works."

"The thing about Michael is that he's not cut out to be a boss. That's it. That's his character flaw. Corporate recognised him for the masterful salesman that he is and made him a manager. Manager and salesman are two different things. If someone is an amazing aerospace engineer, that doesn't mean you can just move them up into the cockpit of a space shuttle. Every time Michael steps outside of his role as a boss, everyone immediately sees him in a completely different light - They see a genius negotiator, a warm-hearted, extroverted and very perceptive person, and a man with surprising amounts of wisdom.

Interestingly, Jim's not cut out to be a boss either. That one day he replaces Michael as acting manager everything falls apart spectacularly and the staff hates him more than they hate Michael."

The happiness I felt for Michael for negotiating and getting his old job back... I was literally giddy from it. It's one of the few moments that REALLY stood out. We saw a vulnerable side of him when he quit. We also saw a very intelligent and persausive salesman side of Michael. Something we never saw before. This scene shows Michael's heart for his work and collegues. You can think what you want of him but this scene will never fail to bring respect to him.

Let’s talk about Jim for a second. He’s the person that once said “I can’t see this being my career” yet he still works there. They ALL do. Huh..seems strange.

Yeah sure, he hosts silly parties, he forms sentences in odd ways and is not always work appropriate. But he’s a great leader, motivator and very charismatic. He quite literally strong-armed Dunder Mifflin into a multi million dollar buyout.

"A lot of people view Micheal as a kind of sales savant/general idiot but I think the unspoken truth of his character is that he has adult ADHD, and outside of the more heavy satire it's actually a fairly realistic depiction. There are THOUSANDS of companies where the best salesmen make more money than their managers, but just don't have the organization or the emotional stability to manage other people effectively. That's why there are plenty of nominal v.p or executive positions that reflect competence, but don't come with any real management responsibility. The warrant officer position in the military is actually a perfect example of this. Specialists are promoted to it because they're good at their jobs, but that competence often doesn't translate to managerial competence. Micheal is a perfect example of someone who was promoted to an administrative position when they should have just been promoted to a title-holding sales position that didn't require them to manage other people. It's not that Micheal is an idiot/sales savant, he's just an excellent salesman with skills that don't translate to management. He's smart, he's just a different kind of smart."

"Michael forced David into a position to twice insist he wouldn't fire Charles to give him (Michael) the upper hand going forward with the negotiations. Michael knew he had his job back at that point. Next, Charles probably makes close to six figures a year, so Michael's leverage was insisting they rehire Pam for probably half of what they're paying Charles. Easy win. Ryan was the wildcard, but David knows the company would never allow Ryan to even attempt to climb the corporate ladder again and would be earning even less than Pam, so it was a pretty even deal, leaning slightly in Michael's favor. That's why David and Charles slinked away at the end - they got outbid by a person they both thought was a complete idiot. Michael's ""smart"" moments are my favorite parts of the show."

"Technically Michael's strategy of constantly starting new paper companies to take away steal Dunder Mifflin clients wouldn't work after the second or third new company because the clients would stop supplying Michael soon enough due to the fact he wouldn't have the money to continue operations and buy more paper. Undercutting Dunder Mifflin makes his company lose money, and so every business would just go under. Eventually, suppliers, knowing of the inconsistent nature and lack of money to pay for their products that Michael has, would stop committing to his businesses and instead go back to Dunder Mifflin, a far safer, more reliable buyer who would actually be able to pay every order and order large supplies of paper (more business and profit for the suppliers)"

"It's David Wallace 



_And Gromit_"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
One of my favorite moments
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Michael’s consistent defense of Ryan is the worst part about him.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"So wait, did they get their jobs back *and* the 60k?"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"When David left the room for the last time after the deal was completed you can tell he has a sense of respect from Michael, that slight smile, when he said yeah after being asked if they could have the room"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
You could make an hour long video of Michael Scott moments that warm your heart. Truly a top tier TV Boss.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I can’t be the only one that is curious about what the first offer was going to be.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I wonder how many clip and title combos they can come up.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I love how Pam is impressed with Michael's negotiation skills at 1:08
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
You should do a scene from every episode and season
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
It's like the smartest Michael has ever been in his life an temp was just dumb
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Pam's face at 1:07 is exactly our face at this same time
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
David Wallace was such a great and patient boss man lol putting up with someone like Michael is stressful and frustrating Lmfaoo. He was always really nice to Michael too and let him slide so many times.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Michael Scott is so smart until thing start going well
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
2:49 😂😂😂😂😂
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
David is just such a good guy!! I am happy he moved away from Suck It and into the thing he is.made for 😅
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"I respect Michael Scott so much.
1.Great Boss (he goofs off but he gets the job done and keeps the branch from closing!)
2.Has a real and genuine personality (He says things and does things to brighten the day!)
3.LOYAL (He has that never leave a man behind mentality that I respect so much!)
4. Really Cares ( When a boss really cares about their employees everyone feels like a team!)
5. Because he is him :)"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
One of my most favorite arcs in the series
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Wallace realizes he is dealing with the top salesman and accepts defeat
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Seeing Charles leave and Michael cutting him off while he tried to say goodbye to the office is one of the most oddly satisfying moments of the series.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"I want a Sebring..

This is legitimately the smartest Michael’s ever been on the show.

Michael is such a wholesome character.

"“Ryan cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars”

-Michael Scott"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
This is a good scene for so many reasons. This is way you take a raise over a bonus check. Bonuses aren’t guaranteed every year but a raise is usually constant and hardly ever goes down. Always take the fishing poll over the fish.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I love Competent Michael almost as much as Incompetent Michael.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
It's not personal... it's just personal business.  Big difference. There is no one.. NO ONE... I would rather go to the mattresses with then Ryan.  Just yesterday he was helping me shop for mattresses. 😘😘😘
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
This is my favorite scene from this show called The Office. Felt so good to see Scott being super smart (for a change) lol
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Michael is so badass in this episode
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
This is Michael Scott's most brilliant moment.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
This was Michael’s greatest moment
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"One of my favorite Michael Scott moments. 
This and the moment at Chili’s where he gets the client. 

I love goofy, inappropriate Michael. However, it’s great to see him shine as a businessman & remind the audience how he got to the position he holds for most of the show."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"The one thing that was the most annoying is how all the salesman were rude to Ryan 
and Pam afterwards, and told Michael he needed to apologize to them, even though he offered them jobs with him and none of them followed."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Michael owned them in this conversation
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I think we can all agree that Charles was the worst. Like Robert California was better (I actually think that Micheal and Robert would be very entertaining if they happened at the same time).
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"“Wouldn’t you have a fishing pole, than a fish?”"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Remember he was promoted to manager from salesman.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"You see everyone is saying that Micheal was a brilliant salesman. And that is so true, But does anyone else see that Pam knows it too? The fact that she smiles shows that this is why she trusted him. And other things, too. She was the only one that left with him. She was the only one that belived in him in *many* situtions. (Also ignore my spelling its sucks I know)"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"Ryan low key admitting he would steal the $60,000 and leave town."

!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"Finally, this is one of the best micheal moments in the show and it’s never been on YouTube until now"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
One of the most triumphant moments of The Office. Love it
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"The fact that Michael is actually this intelligent and this wise really makes you wonder about his entire character in subtle ways, what does it mean if he is capable of this kind of critical thinking? Why? What? How? ???"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Felt bad for Charles when he walked out he knew he just lost his job
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"Others : Commenting exactly what the characters said and getting lots of likes.
Me : Woah. Now that’s a comment.
🤨😏"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
I sometimes doubted his ability in making a joke but never his skills in salemanship.

"This was one of those rare moments where you see that Michael Scott was, in the words of Jim, ""a great boss"".  It's when the Office veers back into the reality of daily office life for a time and reminds you of how great his character was."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"They should’ve had the deal close with Michael saying our balls our in your court then the scene cuts to David leaving the room and then Michael, Pam , and Ryan celebrating like how they did. It brings a sort of tension or small feeling that u might enjoy. Idk I’m not a director I shouldn’t know. 


Edit: would go like this: 4:10 - 4:18 then it cuts to 4:36"

He was never going to give up, and he was always going to be a problem for DM unless they hired him back. You want him on your team, not the other team"

"0:15 why do I get the feeling that $12,000 was actually their first offer and not the second one. I'm sure David knew Michael was just being Michael."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
“our balls are in your court” what does that mean?
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
One of the few times Michael shows that he only is a dolt when the cameras are on and he's getting spotlight attention.  There's a reason he's a stellar salesman.  He performs here and the scene where Jan and him nail the sale at the Chilis.  He's very competent in the right areas.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"This is the reason why Charles Miner was the worst manager I've ever seen. By not acceding to Michael's simple demands, he set a whole series of events into motion, that ended up with the branch losing sales and DM having to spend money to get back two employees who left the company and one which they didn't even want back. Remember that rundown he had Jim do? Horrible communication skills.

There's a reason why Michael was more qualified to run the branch than Charles was."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
The scene with Kelly and Angela is so unexpected which is what makes it so funny

Micheal was like Micheal Jordan of sales in season 5
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
One of Michael Scott's finest moments.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Wallace’s smile at 1:10 in my opinion is a similar reaction to the one Pam had after michael finished talking. It was brief but in that moment he realizes exactly why Michael was the one chosen to run the branch & he’s not the Buffoon he or other makes him out to be so and immediately he realizes he can’t lowball him

I like how the show allowed Michael to flex his intelligence and capabilities. Otherwise him being regional manager or even keeping his job would be entirely unbelievable.

"David : How about 60,000 dollars ? 
Michael : *Shocked pikachu face *"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
Michael might be a moron he is a damn good salesman
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"Micheal may not be the smartest or easiest to like, but he knows business in a way that many others don't. He prioritizes relations over profit and when he said he could easily rebuild his paper company, I have no doubt he could. Simply through his connections and a likable business man."

i never understood how michael could be a manager until i watched this episode.

"""Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under I will just start another paper company."" 
-Michael Scott

One of my favorite lines from him"
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"Michael at his finest and most competent. Not only did he secure the deal, he looked out for his own people and made sure they got a better deal than anything they were expecting and they all walked away with more. Even though David apparently loses a lot of money on this deal, he knows that Michael's branch has always delivered and will continue to deliver for as long as he gets to be manager there so in the long term, Michael would make him money."

David Wallace:  Michael! 
Michael:  That's one of  'em!"

Michael was smart whenever he needed to.
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
The fact that Charles was a yes-man was the reason he didn't prevent Wallace from making such a deal. Any other person and he woul have stopped Wallace. I love how realistically they handled this storyline.

How he negotiated contains so many business principles in several disciplines. It goes to show that he's lazy most of the time but a genius when the situation really calls for it.

Michael actually really handled the negotiation well... He was able to get an unbelievable deal.

"And that's the answer to the question everyone's been asking the whole time: why is Michael the manager of Dunder Mifflin. He may seem stupid, but he's a *brilliant* salesman.

!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"The show after the first season did a job of making Michael a little more relatable, sympathetic and competent.  Much more complex and interesting. This clip shows that while he is often foolish, occasionally he can read the situation perfectly and deal with it, which made him a great salesman. 1/10 times he will win a battle and that will save his job."

"""There are certain defining moments in a person’s life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.
